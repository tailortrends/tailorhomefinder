    "text":"This stunning 1927 Tudor Revival nestled in the Willo Historic District exudes a perfect blend of charm and elegance, with a French-inspired flair and has been featured in Phoenix Home and Garden and the AZ Republic. The home's curb appeal is captivating, featuring a steep-pitched gable roof, an arched entry adorned with stone quoins and porte-cochre. Landscape artist Benjy Levinson designed the lush landscaping along with the quaint front patio and custom iron gates designed to echo the 1920s, which further enhance the property's charm. Known as the P.W. Womack house, named after its original owner, a prominent builder in town who also worked on projects like the Paradise Valley Country Club, this property boasts tall, coved ceilings and gorgeous original hardwood floors throughout. The beautiful living and dining rooms were refurbished by designer Christopher K. Coffin. The centerpiece of the formal living room with its soaring ceilings is the fireplace that has an original tile border and flanked by windows that flood the space with natural light. The dining room features a silver-leafed ceiling and navy walls, complemented by French doors that lead to a charming side patio. The sunny kitchen is a sweet space with gorgeous black-and-white striped wood floors, a brick-exposed wall, a vintage O'Keefe Merritt gas stove, and a charming breakfast nook. The separate family room offers a cozy retreat with a gas fireplace and seamlessly connects to an outdoor patio. The primary suite with views of the backyard and downtown high-rises beyond, provides a peaceful retreat with a serene cream-white color palette, including a claw-foot soaking tub in the bathroom. A rare feature in historic homes is the large, walk-in closet (designed by California Closets). The front guest bedroom overlooks the front yard, while the third bedroom is currently set up as an office. The charming guest bathroom features a cast iron tub enclosed in an original arched spaced. There is a separate large laundry room, with an inside storage room beyond. The home is powered by two separate AC\/heating units. In the backyard, Levinson's design includes a fountain in the center, connected by formal walkways, a popular feature in French landscapes. The backyard also includes a built-in gas grill and covered dining\/entertaining space. The inviting brick side patio, adorned with potted plants and a gas fireplace, is the perfect spot for coffee or happy hour. The convenient location makes it within walking distance to all the offerings of Midtown - great restaurants, museums, and light rail (Heard Museum) stop. With safety in mind, this home is not connected to a back alleyway. This lovely property is not one to miss. BRAND NEW roof and all new exterior paint!",

    "text":"Penthouse Dreams in the Roosevelt Arts District. A rare opportunity to own one of a few true penthouses in Metro Phoenix. Set along the grass-and-tree-lined streets of the historic Roosevelt District, where mid-century style meets dramatic skyline and mountain views, this two-bedroom, two-bath penthouse spills out onto one of the largest penthouse balconies in the US. The balcony wraps around 2 sides of the building with unobstructed 270-degree views of the Phoenix skyline and mountain ranges that stretch more than fifty miles. Mornings feel cinematic, nights glow electric, and every sunset hits like a live art installation. Inside, floor-to-ceiling windows flood the home with natural light, blurring the line between indoors and out. The open layout flows easily from kitchen to living to balcony. It's a low-key trophy property, modern with soul. For the collector at heart, the seller who has called this building home since 1991 is offering something even rarer: the adjacent penthouse is also available, allowing both units to be combined into an expansive 2,704-square-foot dream home in the sky. Select artwork by Red-Chip artist Bill Dambrova is available for purchase, transforming this space into a living gallery. HOA fees include electricity, water, gas, sewer, trash, parking, hazard insurance and CAM. The building offers secure access, a pool area, and fitness center, steps from the vibrant Roosevelt Arts District, brimming with culture, dining, and nightlife. With a Walk Score of 92 and Bike Score of 87, this location defines convenience and connection. This isn't just a home, it's a flex, a statement, and a front-row seat to the city's evolution. Own the view. Own the vibe. Own the moment. Let your next chapter begin",

    "text":"Located on the 5th floor of the historic Orpheum Lofts, this one-bedroom, one-bath residence enjoys a desirable setting with impressive views of the downtown city lights. The generously sized layout features soaring 10'8'' ceilings, wood flooring, exposed ductwork, and distinctive red brick walls, all contributing to an open, loft-style design. The building itself is solidly constructed of concrete and brick, offering both character and durability. In addition to in-unit storage, the home includes a large, secured basement storage locker measuring approximately 6' x 8'. Situated on the light rail and in the heart of downtown Phoenix, the location offers exceptional walkability to restaurants, entertainment venues, theaters, movie houses, sports and Roosevelt Row. This is a unique chance to own a true piece of Phoenix history. Utility costs are billed monthly through the HOA. The Orpheum Lofts is one of the few historic downtown Phoenix buildings thoughtfully reimagined as residences. Originally constructed in the 1930s as the Phoenix Title and Trust Building, the property was completely gutted and renovated in classic Art Deco style. The lofts feature open floor plans with trendy exposed ductwork and warm brick walls. From the moment you enter the retro lobby, highlighted by marble and terrazzo tile, you know this is not \"typical\" Phoenix living. Residents can enjoy the second-floor interior courtyard, an ideal spot for morning coffee or gathering with friends. Additional amenities include a heated swimming pool and spa, sauna, steam room, club room, fitness center, conference room, storage lockers, and concierge services. Parking is conveniently located next door.",

    "text":"A five-story brownstone reimagined by Studio Syltebo \/ PHX Historic, this residence rejects the ordinary. Paris meets Manhattan energy runs through sultry loft lines, tailored stone and couture surfaces. The main level centers on an integrated great room with built-in seating and a concealed scullery made for quiet decadence. The full-floor primary stuns with a 14' limestone shower sourced abroad, a flex studio space, secondary wet room and elevator access. Below, a private guest suite, media lounge and oversized turf courtyard create an unexpected subterranean retreat. Above, a skyline terrace and rooftop flex room frame South Mountain and possibility. Every surface feels curated, architectural and singular-more art piece than property, awaiting its next steward.",

    "text":"A five-story brownstone reimagined by Studio Syltebo \/ PHX Historic, this residence rejects the ordinary. Paris meets Manhattan energy runs through sultry loft lines, tailored stone and couture surfaces. The main level centers on an integrated great room with built-in seating and a concealed scullery made for quiet decadence. The full-floor primary stuns with a 14' limestone shower sourced abroad, a flex studio space, secondary wet room and elevator access. Below, a private guest suite, media lounge and oversized turf courtyard create an unexpected subterranean retreat. Above, a skyline terrace and rooftop flex room frame South Mountain and possibility. Every surface feels curated, architectural and singular-more art piece than property, awaiting its next steward.",
