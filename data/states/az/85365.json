On the North Shore, we call the house a scraper because most people will demo the entire unit to build their perfect river home. Build a new home, or toss a 40-foot 5th wheel on it for a few years. The key benefit to this 1.24-acre property is that it owns approximately 140 feet of shoreline, including the private boat launch & 40-foot private dock. The well has a new 25GPM pump and bladder tank in 3rd qtr 2024, with spare 25GPM pump - things happen at the river. Garage is a keeper (2x6 walls, built for a second floor if desired). Garage has 12-foot drop ceilings hanging 2 feet below trusses, two 10-foot doors, bath, kitchen. 4 bay garage (30 x 40) with ~28 x 10 enclosed boat garage on the south east side butted up to garage.",

    "text":"A Cozy Home with Room to Grow. This adorable, charming home has a warm and welcoming feel the moment you walk in. It's clearly been cared for over the years and is just waiting for someone to give it a little refresh. With two bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a comfortable living space, its the perfect size for a first-time buyer, someone looking to downsize, or anyone looking to do some of their touches. The kitchen is functional but a bit dated, giving you the chance to add your own style and updates over time. Tile flooring and new carpet and padding. The yard is just right for easy maintenance or a bit of gardening. There is a screened room with jacuzzi but seller has never used . If you're looking for a home with good bones and lots of potential, this ones worth a look. A little updating will go a long way!",

    "text":"Exceptionally well cared for home by one owner occupant over the past 23 years. Five stars plus 10 more. The kitchen has been totally redone from cabinets to countertops. Master bath walk-in shower has be beautifully and tastefully retiled in neutral shades. Both vanities have custom made cabinets. Living room with a bay window and one of the only units with a built in fireplace. Vaulted ceilings. A side yard with grass, which is typically unheard of in El Descanso. Along with a 2-car garage, a rarity. Open patio with wrought iron security gates between the shaded back patio and the yard. Nicely landscaped yard with a pergola. The lot is larger than most in the subdivision. It would be extremely difficult, if not impossible to find a cleaner, more well cared for home than this one.",
