Well laid out kitchen with plenty of counter space and cabinetry. UV reverse osmosis system. Roof with ridge venting for increased energy efficiency installed 3 years ago (transferable warranty). Landscaping recently re-done with new irrigation system and beautiful pavers both front and back. Landscape lighting for nighttime ambience. A secondary structure in back, currently being used as a homeschool classroom, would make a perfect office for a remote worker, or a workout room for a fitness enthusiast. And a Lifetime storage shed for even more storage. Great location, with easy access to highways and close proximity to shopping and dining. A must-see!!",
