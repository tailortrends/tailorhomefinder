    "text":"Dreaming of a ranch-style compound with space to live, host, and store your toys? This unique property situated on 1 acre of land in the Tanque Verde Valley has it all. Perfect for multigenerational living, guests, or rental income, the property includes a main house with guest quarters plus a free-standing casita with a full kitchen and bathroom, dog run, and front and back porches. Outside, there's serious room for vehicles and gear: an extended 2-car garage with built-ins, overhead storage, and 400-amp panel wired for two EV chargers, a ramada that can double as a 3-car carport, 2 uncovered spaces, 2 shipping containers, a shed, and a spot to set up an RV dump hookup. For those who've dreamed of a small-scale homestead, you'll find a greenhouse with water and electric, citrus and pomegranate trees, rainwater and greywater harvesting that feeds the front and back irrigation, an outdoor industrial steel sink with counter space, and a chicken coop. Inside the main house you'll discover scored concrete floors throughout, high ceilings, and a welcoming foyer with oversized rustic oak doors that open to the living area. In addition to the 3 bedrooms and 2 full baths, a separate guest quarters with full bathroom and mini-split can be accessed from the back porch or through the garage. The primary suite boasts a huge custom walk-in closet, extended-height vanity with granite, and French doors that open directly to the 70' covered back porch and hot tub. The roomy kitchen features an oversized porcelain farmhouse sink, newer appliances, stainless range hood, breakfast bar, and tons of storage with space for an island or large dining table. Recent updates bring peace of mind: roof inspected and repaired (2025), fresh exterior paint (2025), newer water heater (2024), newer HVAC (2022), plus smart door entry for both the main and guest houses. All this just a short walk to schools and Agua Caliente Park, minutes to some of Tucson's best hiking, and an easy escape to Rose Canyon Lake and Summerhaven.",

Bursting with wild life. Peaceful and quiet. Utilities accessible along Bonanza Ave. include water, natural gas, electricity, cable\/data\/phone. Bonanza Road was resurfaced in 2024! Check out the schools! Great location: only three miles to groceries, gas, restaurants, library, gym, pharmacy, banking and so much more. Just over 2 miles to the start of the scenic drive going up to Mt Lemmon. Room for horses. This gorgeous lot has a large, level, secluded building area that is tucked away from the road and is well above the 100-year flood plain of the wash.",
