Continuing down the hall, you'll find a powder bath and the staircase to the second floor. From there, you enter the open kitchen, dining area, and family room, with a patio located just off the dining space. Upstairs, a spacious loft connects to the primary bedroom, which features a primary bath, two walk-in closets, and a linen closet. Three additional bedrooms-each with its own walk-in closet-are also located on the second floor. Two of the bedrooms share a full bath, and the fourth bedroom has an additional bathroom available.
