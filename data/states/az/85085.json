    "text":"Perched high on a hillside and backed by natural terrain, this one-of-a-kind 2.5-acre estate offers commanding mountain vistas, sweeping city-light views, and an unmatched sense of privacy. Thoughtfully positioned to maximize elevation and scenery, the property provides rare separation from neighboring homes and endless possibilities for expansion, horses, or additional structures-without compromise. The home itself showcases a warm, modern farmhouse aesthetic that sets it apart from typical desert architecture. Inside, soaring ceilings, wood-look flooring, and an open, light-filled great room create a refined yet inviting atmosphere. The kitchen is both stylish and functional, featuring granite countertops, stainless steel appliances, generous cabinetry, and a large pantry, seamlessly connecting to the main living spaces. The primary suite offers vaulted ceilings, a walk-in closet, and a beautifully appointed ensuite bath, while a versatile den provides flexible living space ideal for a home office, media room, or guest area. Outdoors, the property transforms into a private desert retreat. Take in panoramic mountain views by day and sparkling city lights by night from the expansive backyard, offering ample space for entertaining, relaxation, or future customization. A concrete-covered 18' x 40' RV slab provides ideal space for recreational vehicles or toys, and a well-maintained storage shed adds practical convenience. Meticulously maintained and move-in ready, the home offers exceptional peace of mind. All well equipment is brand new as of April 2025 and paired with a comprehensive water filtration system including pre-filtration, reverse osmosis, and UV bacteria removal. The well water was professionally lab tested in October 2025 with excellent results. The roof and HVAC systems are approximately six years old and in excellent working order, ensuring major systems have already been thoughtfully addressed. With no HOA, low utility costs, a private well, and close proximity to hiking trails, this rare hillside property delivers a refined desert lifestyle defined by views, acreage, and uncompromising care.",
