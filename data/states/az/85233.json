Sophisticated light fixtures. Large backyard with covered patio. New roof underlayment replaced in February 2025. Very close to all 3 main freeways in East Valley; freeways 101, new 202, and 60. Walking distance to Del Rey Elementary school. Baseball, Pickleball, Basketball, Volleyball, and Tennis courts are closed by. Just a mile + away from Gilbert downtown for your night life activities.

Picture yourself waking up in a beautiful, low-maintenance condo bathed in morning light-right in the heart of Downtown Gilbert.

Feel like staying in? Lounge by the sparkling pool with a book or a iced drink, grill up something delicious in the shaded BBQ areas with friends, or challenge your neighbors to a game of sand volleyball. Want to keep your body as happy as your heart? The on-site gym is ready when you are. Every path you walk, every breeze you catch, every sunset you watch from your patio will remind you",
