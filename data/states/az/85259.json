    "text":"Fully Furnished Opportunity! Whether you rent it out or entertain here, you and your guests will feel transported to a private family resort in this newly renovated one-of-a-kind custom home! From the moment you drive up, you're wowed by artistically manicured lush lawns and breathtaking mountain views. The circular driveway brings you to the front door, leads to the 4-car garage, or wraps around to the RV gate. Step through the double-wide front doors into a dramatic two-story foyer, where your eyes are immediately drawn either straight back to the stunning resort-style backyard or up to the soaring ceilings highlighted by LED-lit stairs. Walk through the formal dining area, complete with temperature-controlled wine storage, and into a kitchen that opens seamlessly to the great room. This kitchen doesn't lack in functionality or style; from a full wall of cabinets and a custom range hood to a panel-front refrigerator, elegance flows from floor to ceiling. A massive island,topped with beautifully veined marble and surrounded by ample seating, anchors the space. The breakfast nook features stylish lighting, and the spacious living room is centered around an elegant statement wall, which is a guaranteed conversation piece with the 100\" TV display. Picture windows throughout this space frame views of the incredible amenities waiting just outside. The primary suite on the first floor offers more than enough space for everything you need, including a cozy sitting area with private access to your backyard oasis. The en-suite bath continues the theme of high design and function, with dual vanities, a makeup station, LED mirrors, and stunning floor-to-ceiling tile that carries from the freestanding tub to the oversized steam shower with rain head. Guest bedrooms and bathrooms carry the same level of thoughtful design, featuring elegant colors, textures, tiles, marble finishes, and beautiful mirrors throughout. Step into the must-see backyard and instantly feel transported. The covered patio offers ceiling fans and multiple lounging areas. The outdoor BBQ zone is partially covered and includes a smoker, stone countertops, and plenty of fun seating. The sparkling pool truly has something for everyone: baja step lounging areas, a water slide, a relaxing spa, and even a grotto behind a cascading waterfall. Watch the kids splash in the custom splash pad or explore the multiple play areas, including two playgrounds, an in-ground trampoline, and space to play basketball or play pickleball or mini golf on the extensive putting green. All surrounded by gorgeous mountain views. When the sun sets, unwind around the outdoor firepit while enjoying a movie on the massive 85\" screen. Out here you will also have access to the newly added guest house, seamlessly integrated into the backyard for even more comfort and flexibility. Outside the casita, you'll find a stylish outdoor shower and a private wraparound covered patio with swing seating. Inside, the collapsible glass wall opens to a beautifully designed space with a full wet bar with fridge, hangout area, two bedrooms, and a full bath, all with direct access to the pool and outdoor amenities. This home is fully equipped with a state-of-the-art, fully integrated Control4 AVN system and surround sound speakers throughout the interior and backyard. The custom lighting can be seamlessly automated and controlled through the Control4 system, allowing for a fully personalized smart home experience. The security system features 4K high-definition surveillance, providing top-tier protection. Exuding luxury, comfort, and character, this one-of-a-kind masterpiece offers an unmatched living experience that blends technology, and entertainment with timeless design.",

    "text":"Located in the gated community of Sonoran Heights, this beautifully updated home combines quality finishes with thoughtful design. The remodeled kitchen includes custom alder cabinetry, granite counters, tumbled stone backsplash, center island, and GE Profile appliances with convection oven, Advantium microwave, and 5-burner cooktop. A spacious great room, plantation shutters, and porcelain tile flooring create an inviting interior. The primary suite bathroom has been reconfigured with a new walk-in shower, tub, cabinetry, and designer finishes. A versatile guest room features a built-in Murphy bed. Outdoors, enjoy a north-facing backyard with extended covered patio, sparkling pool and built-in BBQ - ideal for entertaining and everyday living. Close to hiking trails and top-rated schools. This home has been meticulously cared for, and it shows. As you enter through the artistically designed rain glass and iron front door you will be greeted by the oversized great room overlooking the full length north facing covered patio where you will experience year-round shade. The home also shows off its soaring ceilings, the light, bright split floorplan with tiled flooring in all the right places. The primary suite is super-sized with space for a charming sitting area. The primary bath was redesigned from its original layout to incorporate a snail shower and oversized tub. This bathroom exudes style with its modern finishes. Both secondary bedrooms were customized as well - one with a murphy bed and the other with custom built in desks and cabinetry for the work from home business. The nucleus of any home is the family room - the perfect space for hanging out or entertaining. This family room features a custom built in cabinet with beverage fridge and fireplace - perfect for those cozy nights in or Superbowl parties. The renovated center island kitchen combines comfort and elegance as it is perfectly located to access the family room, great room, and back patio. Even better - there is a large walk-in pantry, breakfast bar, and all stainless GE Profile appliances... even the refrigerator stays. The backyard oasis is steps away where paradise awaits - a fully extended covered patio with year-round shade and a sparking play pool that is also good year-round for summer cooling or winter cold plunges. The built in BBQ with bar is perfectly located outside the kitchen and eat-in dining room. With the McDowell Mountains expanding across the north, you are steps away from several walking, hiking, and biking paths. Close to shopping and great restaurants too. The proximity to the top-rated Scottsdale schools makes for a great morning walk - there is even a path from the community to Anasazi elementary school. Basis (grades 5-12) is a short drive for an accelerated curriculum.",

You will not find better value in a HOA with manned gates, manicured grounds, swimming pools, clubhouse, tennis and pickleball courts. The vibrant lifestyle has people out walking and cycling all day. It also has ease of convenience to many walking trails. The home itself is a fantastic 2 bed and a den where the den separates the 2 beds. Travertine tile is in all the main walkways and wood floors adorn the bedrooms and den. Entering, you have a formal living and dining room with a wonderful fireplace. The kitchen has granite counters and abundant cabinets along with an eat in kitchen area. The back yard has a relaxing paver covered patio. New roof 2022",

    "text":"Perched on an elevated cul-de-sac lot in gated Rancho Trinidad, this custom remodeled Southwest-inspired home delivers panoramic Camelback Mountain and city-light views that are impossible to ignore. Inside, the layout is built for both privacy and easy gathering, offering nearly 4,800 sq ft, 5 bedrooms all with ensuite baths, and open living spaces framed by oversized windows that bring the desert backdrop straight into the home. The chef's kitchen centers around a large island and includes Sub-Zero & Thermador appliances, gas range, granite counters, walk-in pantry, and seamless flow into the family and dining areas. The owner's suite sits in its own wing: quiet, generous in size, and finished with a sitting area, coffee bar, double-sided fireplace, and an expansive walk-in closet. The remodeled spa bath features separate vanities, a soaking tub with jets, walk-in shower, and mountain views. The backyard delivers true Arizona living with a heated pool & spa, multiple patios, an elevated city-light view deck, outdoor kitchen, fireplace, and manicured desert landscaping. It handles everything from quiet evenings to large gatherings with ease. Additional highlights include an oversized 4-car garage with new epoxy floors, split guest wing with ensuite bedrooms and walk-in closets, updated lighting, tall viga-accented ceilings, hardwood and tile flooring, window treatments, and a soft water + RO system. Set in a quiet community near Desert Mountain HS, BASIS, hiking trails, shopping, dining, and Mayo Clinic. Properties with this level of view, privacy, and craftsmanship rarely hit the market.",

The kitchen has been redesigned with Timberlake white shaker cabinetry, Calacatta Gold Cambria quartz counters with a waterfall edge, soft-close tension, custom pull-out drawers, and Jeffrey Alexander hardware. A southeast-facing kitchen window adds natural light-perfect for herbs or plants-while new stainless appliances, a reverse osmosis system, and custom lighting elevate the space for everyday comfort and entertaining. Altogether, the kitchen remodel was $39,000. Throughout the interior, you'll find new luxury vinyl plank flooring ($11,000)(extra flooring is on-site), fresh paint, new baseboards, doors, and trim, and fans with remotes for added convenience. Every outlet cover, light fixture, and mirror was replaced for a cohesive, modern aesthetic. The primary suite features a luxurious $7,000 California Closets system, while both bathrooms showcase Cambria Sandgate quartz counters, new cabinetry, new toilets, and upgraded fixtures. Bedroom 2 features a Murphy bed system and cabinet tower ($4,500) for a seamless transition from office\/den to guest quarters. This home has also been meticulously updated behind the scenes: a 2021 HVAC system (with heat pump), 2022 50 gallon electric hot water heater, new whole-house water filtration system and reverse osmosis at kitchen sink both by Puragain ($4,900), HOA redid roof approximately six years ago, new garbage disposal, new refrigerator, microwave, washer and dryer, and a Vivint alarm system (owned). Even the unseen details have been handled including re-piping of entire plumbing system by Re-Pipe Specialists ($6,450)and a $2,000 professional sealing of the entire property for pest prevention completed during the remodel. Ample storage is provided by the closet on the rear covered patio. Set within a gated community, this residence offers the perfect balance of privacy and connection. The building sits adjacent to the community's heated pool, spa, gym, and clubhouse, so amenities are just steps away yet quietly tucked around the corner from your unit. The community also features walking paths, lush landscaping refreshed in 2025, and ample guest parking, with your own reserved covered space included. The location is ideal - just moments from Mountainside Fitness, Albertsons, dining, and freeway access - all in a pet-friendly community where short-term rentals are not permitted, preserving peace and stability year-round. From the mountain and treetop views to the craftsmanship of its remodel, this home represents the best of relaxed, resort-style Scottsdale living. Whether you're looking for a seasonal getaway or a full-time sanctuary,",

This custom estate offers over 6,000 sq ft of pure Mediterranean-inspired luxury. Step through the grand entry and into a space that feels like a boutique Mediterranean resort, defined by a dramatic barrel-vaulted brick ceiling, rich textures, and timeless architectural symmetry. Old World craftsmanship is felt in every detail; hand-laid stonework, intricate flooring inlays, warm plaster walls, and the sculptural floor-to-ceiling hearth anchoring your first impression. Dining room's custom Marano chandelier, brought in from Italy, conveys with the home. The flowing layout includes formal and casual gathering spaces, a chef's kitchen, and multiple entertainment zones, all designed to frame the iconic view. Five en-suite bedrooms, including a private guest wing, deliver exceptional comfort and privacy. Five and a half bathrooms echo the home's villa-like ambiance with stone finishes and refined European styling. Outside, the home transforms into a resort-style haven, sparkling infinity pool and spa, multiple loggias, fire features, and uninterrupted southwest-facing Arizona views that feel cinematic from sunrise to dusk.

    "text":"Well thought out repricing on this beauty. Mediterranean inspired and architecturally designed this, home was created precisely to maximize every detail of the views, the wonderful high desert natural vegetation it lives within AND the incredible privacy and serenity that you won't find elsewhere. The city light views are at least 180 degrees and then natural high desert vegetation in all other directions. A true work of art, providing timeless design, 4 bedrooms 3 of which are ensuite and most rooms have private exterior access to accent Arizona's indoor\/outdoor living. The home has a true chef's kitchen\/catering kitchen, six burner gas stove, copper clad stove hood, 2 dishwashers, pantry with full size freezer, all top rated appliances in custom designed and imported Downsview cabinets. This is not just a great view home, nor just a large 8\" stucco quality project, all designer done, Chihuly glass in 5 spaces, Murano chandelier from Italy, but look at the romantic outdoor living! Heated pool\/spa overlooking the city and WAY too many features to detail that make living here like the best vacation ever. Long private drive and parking\/staging with pavers lead to a spacious 4 car garage, and on to the entry way over a bridge to the custom entry doors. The benefits of Scottsdale Mountain itself are amazing, from beautiful land planning and thoughtful NAOS thruout the project of 718 homesites to the Tennis and pickleball Center, community ramada and spa, all wrapped in the McDowell Mountain preserve behind and around it. It offers 24\/365 guarded and gated security and a few fingers of sub gated set aside privacy. You will feel like you are in a different city, yet are within 30 minutes of Phoenix Sky Harbor International airport, the best schools and world class golf and shopping!",
