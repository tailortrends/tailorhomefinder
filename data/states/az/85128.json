The demo work was completed, and new flooring has been installed in the common areas, complemented by fresh baseboards. The kitchen cabinets have been painted, and select interior finishes have been updated as part of the renovation process. The home is now being offered as a professionally negotiated short sale. It is important to note that the property will not qualify for traditional financing in its current condition. This is a cash, as-is transaction. For those seeking a project with some improvements already in place, this property is a perfect opportunity.",

With three bedrooms and two and a half bathrooms, it offers space for family gatherings and lasting memories. The extended two-car garage fits trucks. Situated on a 1.44-acre irrigated lot at the end of a brand new private street, bordered by open land and custom homes. This ranch-style home-with its giant front porch-is built to endure for generations, your family's forever place. Equestrian lifestyle welcomed. Within city limits with trash pickup and fire protection. Here, family gathers, children play, and evenings fill with stories and laughter. This house is ''to-be-built''. Changes can be made to the finishes and layout but the price may vary. It makes more sense to build right now than to buy",
