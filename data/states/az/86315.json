    "text":"Pride of ownership shows in every inch of this home! The seller has created a very special home with touches that few people even consider...like wallpaper in the closets and pantry! This home IS the life of the party and neighbors and friends have been gathering here for years and there is no shortage of room to entertain. The kitchen is the heart of this home, with beautiful granite counters and island, with more than enough space to lay out a spread fit for a king! During the summer months you can enjoy the back covered patio and artificial turf, perfect for cookouts or maybe a game of cornhole. The bedrooms each have their own special touches that make them warm and inviting...you'll really never need to have another ''stay away'' vacation again! The 3-car garage is 21 1\/2 feet deep, perfect for a large truck. There is also a side gate that allows you an area to park an ATV or flatbed trailer (and even some RV's that meet the HOA guidelines). Exterior of the home is Hardie board siding and roof is 3 years old. And last but not least, the amenities are some of the best in the area. From the large community center with games, pool tables and barbeque areas, to the pools and fitness center, you will not be disappointed. Don't miss your opportunity to make this house your new home!",

    "text":"This single level home is tucked quietly into the end of a cul-de-sac that's only a short drive to the Prescott Valley business area. It enjoys wonderful views of the mountains to the north, east & south that can be seen from inside the home, or from the very private and expansive outdoor patio area with pergola. The yard is nicely ordained with mature vegetation needing little water from the automatic irrigation system. The cozy living room flows openly into the kitchen and dining area and there's a gas fireplace to warm you on those cool winter nights. The kitchen is nicely designed with an abundance of cabinet space, two breakfast bars and a large pantry. The split floor plans allows privacy with the two bedrooms and guest bath on one side and the large primary suite on the other side of the home. The primary suite has a bay window perfect for a sitting area, a large primary bath with custom walk-in shower with bench, soaking tub, dual sinks and large walk-in closet. The attached garage provides room for two vehicles, or one vehicle and workshop. Walking distance to a neighborhood park with gazebo and play ground setup. This is a lot of home for the price. See it soon. We think you'll love it!",

    "text":"Tucked into the scenic Mingus West neighborhood, this RV-friendly, city-connected home offers a rare blend of wide-open beauty, everyday convenience, and thoughtful design just minutes from Prescott National Forest and a short drive to town.The front exterior immediately impresses with inviting curb appeal, featuring a paver driveway, mature landscaping, a covered and enclosed front paver patio, and a desirable corner homesite that provides added privacy with only one shared fence line. Built by Mandalay Homes, this Summit floor plan showcases quality 2x6 construction, spray-foam insulation, a post-tension slab, and an extended three-car garage with an epoxy finish, all designed for comfort and energy efficiency.Inside, the living and great room welcome you with abundant natural light from oversized picture windows on two sides, soaring 10-foot ceilings, and 8-foot doors that enhance the open, airy feel. Wood-plank-style tile flooring flows throughout the main living areas, creating a cohesive and low-maintenance space ideal for both relaxing and entertaining.The kitchen seamlessly connects to the living area and features dark-stained wood cabinetry, quartz countertops, a large center island with breakfast bar seating, a pantry, and stainless steel appliances including a five-burner gas range. The adjacent dining area offers direct access to the covered back patio, making indoor-outdoor gatherings effortless.The primary suite is a true retreat, offering generous space, plush carpeting, and a spa-like bathroom with a rain-glass walk-in shower featuring dual shower heads, a double-sink vanity, and an exceptionally large walk-in closet with built-ins that truly lives up to its reputation.Two additional bedrooms with ceiling fans and carpeting are thoughtfully positioned to flank a well-appointed full bath, providing comfort and privacy for guests or family members. A convenient powder room and laundry room add to the home's functional layout.Out back, the fully fenced backyard is designed for both enjoyment and practicality, featuring a wraparound covered paver patio with gas stub for grilling, breathtaking views of Mingus and Granite Mountains, and unforgettable sunset skies. The RV pad includes full hook-ups and gated access, and the community allows one outbuilding per lot. With low HOA fees that maintain common areas and neighborhood integrity, city water and sewer, a tankless water heater, and an owned water softener system, this home offers a lifestyle that is as easy as it is exceptional.",

    "text":"This is the perfect combination of a beautiful custom home AND the perfect horse property! The spacious interior and attention to detail are the first things you notice when you walk through the welcoming entryway. From the vaulted ceilings, the luxury vinyl flooring and into the living room with it's large stone fireplace, you will be in love with this home! As your gaze moves towards the back sliders the first thing you see is an amazing view of Mingus Mountain. To your right, the kitchen has two large granite counters that offer plenty of room for cooking a gourmet meal or a good old fashioned country feast after a long day of riding. The pantry is a generous size for storing plenty of staples and the refrigerator is newer and spacious as well. The eat-in kitchen is large enough for a full size dining table, or utilize the separate dining area off the entryway. There is no shortage of space to entertain in this home! Cozy up to the fire on a chilly winter evening or enjoy the large cover patio area, complete with hot tub. Or picture yourself roasting marshmallows over the outdoor firepit while enjoying the star filled skies. Indoors, the primary suite is the perfect place to wind down and relax. You can enjoy a nice hot shower or relaxing bubble bath in the beautiful bathroom that comes complete with double sinks and a separate vanity area. Plenty of room in the walk in closet for your fancy duds or boots and jeans. The guest rooms share a jack and jill bath and also have plenty of closet space. The first bedroom also has access to a side deck where you can enjoy the great outdoors while watching the horses frolic in the adjoining fenced area. On the opposite side of the home near the primary suite is a flex room that can be used as an office or guest room. The laundry room has the same beautiful cabinetry and granite counters as the kitchen, with plenty of storage and a utility sink. And if you still need more room wait until you see the 3 car garage with its easy maintenance epoxy flooring! This is also a detached 24 X 12' 1 car garage that can be used for storage or as a workshop as well. If that wasn't all you could imagine...wait until you see the horse amenities! The barn has 2 oversized 16' x 12' stalls, tack room & hay\/feed room. along with a 12' x 36' covered area with open entry for the horses to enjoy in the warmer months. Additionally, they have a corral and round pen for exercising, or trot on down the road and enjoy riding across endless acres of state land. You may even see the wild horses that run through the mountains behind the subdivision! The property also includes mature fruit trees and a couple of pine trees for seasonal decorating. There is a separate portion of the two acres that is also fenced off for other animals or a dog run. Plenty of room to build a guest house...the possibilities are endless!",
