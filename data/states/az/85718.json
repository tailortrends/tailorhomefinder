    "text":"Best views in the Foothills?! Drink coffee and eat breakfast at your kitchen table with picturesque mountains laid out in front of you. Fall asleep to the glorious city lights from the panoramic window in your master bedroom. Huge living room and family room form the heart of the house with cottage-style kitchen, featuring upgraded cabinets. A new, large fireplace warms the hearth room without blocking preferred TV locations. Spacious master bedroom includes a spa-inspired bath that matches the kitchen's aesthetic with dual vanities and waterfall shower. Four additional bedrooms provide opportunities for guest suite, office, library, workout room, and more. Full renovation in 2018 was followed by an additional 50k in upgrades by current owner, including carbon-activated whole house water softener with reverse osmosis for kitchen and refrigerator; new oven and dishwasher; plantation shutters in the living room and master bath. The crown jewel is an owned-not-leased commercial-quality solar array that wipes out your energy costs and fuels your electric car. With tax credits expiring, array will be prohibitively expensive to replicate elsewhere.",

    "text":"If you love a vintage vibe, and you're looking for your forever home, this is it! Situated on 3 plus acres of desert bliss, and built by Tucson-Famous Architect William Hazard, this mid-century home is a stone's throw from the Rillito, with a very productive private well. Many intact original features. Initially built as a 3 bed 2 bath, early on it was expanded off the galley kitchen to include a family\/breakfast room, guest ensuite, and sizeable laundry room. Original stained concrete. Original wood floors. Vintage saltillo. Vaulted ceilings with exposed beams. Large great room with abundant light is adjacent to generous screened-in patio. Primary ensuite has it's own private patio. Two other bedrooms are light filled with sliding glass doors that open onto the back yard. The pool is located in a low-fenced area and landscaped with some natives and some exotics. Beyond the wall is pristine, a true Sonoran desert wildlife sanctuary. From the fenced yard, there is a trail to the guest house, which is also accessible by a long, long driveway. The 1990-built burnt adobe 1 bed\/1 bath is 700+ sqft and has a carport, screened patio and fenced yard. When you visit the guest house, be sure to check out the well. There are flags behind the guest house to guide you there. There is plenty of room at West portion of the property to possibly install horse facilities. This is horse property by zoning. A short walk\/ride to the Rillito and it's multi-use paths. 500+ square feet of storage off the main house carport can be used as-is or potentially developed for additional living space. This property is a must-see. Call for an appointment today!",

    "text":"Such a well loved home. A traditional Santa Fe loaded with charm. This has a lot of original elements, but it was decided long ago that this is one of those spots that is just ''homey''. Envision a home tucked away with a courtyard entrance that is welcoming from the get go. Outside living? Watch the wildlife from the courtyard or enjoy the full length patio, pool, and complete privacy of the back spaces. Saltillo floors, 3 fireplaces, a myriad of windows, and perfectly placed spaces. A family room tucked off the kitchen, step into a large living area, formal dining (that feels casual), and a kitchen that centers the home. A bit difficult to describe, but suffice it to say that this is ''totally Tucson'' Spa has never been used.",

    "text":"Immaculately Maintained Hidden Gem in Flecha Caida Ranch Estates! Tucked away in the heart of the prestigious Catalina Foothills - within one of Arizona's most sought-after school districts- this immaculately maintained burnt adobe residence is a rare opportunity to own a truly private desert retreat in the exclusive Flecha Caida Ranch Estates. Set back from the street on a charming private drive, this multi-level home sits on a generously sized lot and offers the ideal blend of tranquility, flexibility, and modern upgrades. The main residence boasts four spacious bedrooms, all thoughtfully located on the upper level to enhance privacy, while the separate guest Casita provides the perfect accommodation for visiting guests or a lucrative opportunity for rental income. This versatile space has been successfully rented in the past with 30-day minimum leases ideal for traveling nurses or seasonal visitors. Step inside the main house and experience a property that has been thoughtfully upgraded over the years. Major improvements include a new roof (2023), a high-efficiency HVAC system (2022), and a new water heater (2024), ensuring comfort and reliability for years to come. The guest Casita has also benefited from a roof replacement in 2023, and a dedicated AC unit installed in 2018, making it a self-sufficient and inviting space. The home is filled with thoughtful touches and high-quality upgrades throughout. The kitchen, dining room, living room, and all four bedrooms have been outfitted with elegant vinyl flooring (2021). The primary suite features new windows, while the office also enjoys enhanced natural light thanks to its window upgrades. One of the guest bedrooms has a recently added air-conditioning system, further enhancing comfort. The laundry room, guest bathroom, and master bath have all been tastefully updated featuring new toilets, a Jacuzzi tub, Carrera marble vanity, new tile, and a stylish pedestal sink. Entertain or relax in the beautifully refurbished Arizona room, or take in panoramic mountain views of both the majestic Catalinas and western ranges from nearly every angle of the home. The upper and lower deck railings were completely repainted and updated in early 2025, perfect for enjoying the desert sunset or morning coffee in peace. The exterior is equally impressive with extensive updates including new drainage infrastructure on the east side, a new sprinkler system, a replaced front door with a flagstone landing, and a new garage door. The guest Casita has also been brought up to fire code standards with new bedroom windows, and showcases new tile throughout the bedroom and bathroom. One of the most notable upgrades offering long-term peace of mind is the complete plumbing renovation, including new sleeves installed within the original piping an invaluable improvement rarely found in homes of this vintage. This tri-level floorplan offers both function and charm, featuring all four bedrooms upstairs, living, kitchen, and dining on the main level, and a cozy lower-level family room with a fireplace ideal for gatherings or relaxing evenings. Nestled in the quiet foothills, this property enjoys the benefits of a voluntary HOA at just $85\/year, offering light CCR enforcement without the restrictions of a typical subdivision. This is a home that truly offers it all privacy, character, modern enhancements, and income potential at an aggressive price point. Whether you're seeking a full-time residence or a long-term investment in one of Arizona's most desirable ZIP codes, this is an opportunity you don't want to miss. Schedule your private showing today and experience this exceptional desert sanctuary firsthand.",

Let's hit the bottom level where we have 2 more bedrooms, a full bath, another living room\/family room\/flex room. This is also the garage entry level and laundry room. So many options! Backyard is big enough for a pool, and the side yard can remain a basketball court or make it into extra parking. So many options!",

    "text":"Set within Shadow Hills-one of the Catalina Foothills' most coveted enclaves-this home reveals a rare balance of refined craftsmanship and a deep connection to the Sonoran landscape. Every line, surface, and space reflects thoughtful design and enduring quality. Inside, the mountains become part of the architecture. Nearly every room offers remarkable Catalina and Tucson mountain views, with select spaces framing Finger Rock. Morning light softens the ridgeline, while sunset turns the peaks into dramatic silhouettes. The desert becomes a living backdrop-shifting, glowing, and grounding the home in its setting. Exceptional craftsmanship defines the interiors. Vaulted tongue-and-groove ceilings with exposed beams draw the eye upward, while clerestory windows introduce natural light throughout the day. A striking two-way fireplace warms both the living and family rooms, and walls of glass bring the surrounding landscape inside. Architectural niches, arched openings, and curated details blend contemporary Southwestern style with timeless Santa Fe influences. At the heart of the home, the chef's kitchen delivers both function and beauty. Viking cooking appliances and a large KitchenAid refrigerator\/freezer anchor the space, complemented by granite countertops, a generous island, skylights, and a sophisticated tile backsplash. Just steps away, a beautifully appointed beverage bar features dual wine refrigeration, glass-front display cabinets, and a seamless setup for effortless entertaining. The open flow between the kitchen, family room, and breakfast area makes the space ideal for everyday living and hosting. The primary suite is a serene retreat, offering mountain views, a two-way fireplace, and generous proportions. Its remodeled bathroom feels spa-inspired, featuring limestone countertops, a soaking tub, and an oversized glass-block shower, with refined finishes throughout. The additional bedrooms including the guest suite also enjoy mountain views, offering every guest a true Foothills experience. Outdoor living is elevated to a resort level. An expansive covered patio with exposed beam ceiling spans the length of the home, providing multiple lounging and dining zones overlooking the Pebble Tec pool and curated desert landscaping. Bougainvillea, raised planters, mature saguaros, and sculptural agaves create a vibrant yet tranquil setting ideal for both quiet evenings and gatherings with friends. The landscaping itself is desert artistry palo verde, ocotillo, agave, and native cacti placed with intention, forming natural vignettes that feel like living sculptures. Each window frames a moment of the desert's beauty. Set on just under three-quarters of an acre at the end of a cul-de-sac, the home enjoys both space and privacy while still being minutes from La Encantada, St. Philip's Plaza, the farmer's market, Catalina Foothills schools, and top medical facilities. Every return home feels like stepping back into calm. A flexible floorplan supports a wide range of lifestyles, with one bedroom currently serving as a home office complete with a full closet and mountain views. Central vacuum, abundant storage, two fireplaces, a blend of Mexican tile, stone, and carpet flooring all reflect ongoing pride of ownership and meticulous care. The home truly lives newer than its age. Built during a period of architectural integrity and generous lot planning, Shadow Hills is celebrated for its thoughtful design, mature desert landscape, and enduring construction quality. This home embodies everything that has made the neighborhood one of the Foothills' most sought-after. Homes with this level of care, timeless architecture, and this caliber of mountain views rarely come to market. Spend a moment watching the light move across the Catalina range, and you'll understand why properties like this are unforgettable. Your next chapter awaits. The mountains are calling.",

    "text":"Conceived as an intimate dialogue between land, craft, and time, this authentic mud adobe residence is a quiet manifesto of place. Designed and built by James Gray of Stellar Gray Fine Homes, the home rests behind private gates within Adobes De La Vista, a rare enclave of 7 Adobe residences set in the heart of the Catalina Foothills. At 2,639 square feet with 3 bedrooms and 3 baths, the property unfolds as a composed sequence of spaces where architecture feels shaped rather than imposed, emerging naturally from the desert floor. The walls, formed from 16 inch thick stabilized mud adobe, give the home its unmistakable presence and deep sense of permanence. Their mass tempers light and heat, creating interiors that feel calm, grounded, and protective. Plaster surfaces soften the geometry, while stone walls built from rocks gathered on site root the architecture firmly in its surroundings. Antique columns sourced from India introduce a subtle global patina, standing as quiet witnesses to centuries of craftsmanship and lending the home a sense of lived history. At the heart of the residence, the great room gathers living room, dining room, and kitchen into a single, fluid volume. This space feels generous yet restrained, where proportion and material guide the experience rather than ornament. Knotty alder cabinetry brings warmth and texture to the kitchen, its natural grain echoing the organic character of the adobe walls and concrete countertops, providing tactile surfaces reinforcing the honesty of the architecture. Light moves gently across the room throughout the day, reinforcing the feeling that time itself is an essential design element. To the north, the great room opens seamlessly into a sunroom that acts as a luminous threshold between inside and out. Beyond, the north patio reveals an atmosphere reminiscent of San Miguel De Allende - intimate, layered, and quietly celebratory. Here, the architecture encourages pause and reflection, with framed views and shaded edges that invite long afternoons and unhurried evenings. The south facing front courtyard offers a contrasting yet complementary experience. A covered veranda defines the space, creating a sheltered outdoor room that opens directly onto a built-in therapeutic spa. This courtyard serves as both arrival and retreat, a place where water, shade, and adobe walls converge to create a deeply personal sanctuary. Gardens weave throughout the property, offering paths to meander and moments of discovery, reinforcing the idea that this home is not simply occupied, but experienced. Completing the narrative is an owned EnPhase solar system that works in quiet harmony with the thermal mass of the adobe construction. The thick earthen walls naturally moderate interior temperatures, absorbing warmth during the day and releasing it slowly as evening falls, while solar energy supports efficient and sustainable living. Together, these elements create a residence that feels timeless yet forward thinking, where comfort, responsibility, and beauty exist in effortless balance.",

    "text":"Range price $799,000-$850,000. Welcome to Casa Del Charro-an amazing multifunctioning estate in the Catalina Foothills surrounded by Tucson's charming desert landscape with premium amenities nearby. This Southwestern property features a main living space on the ground floor with 2 bedrooms, each with its own bathroom and access to the outdoors. There is a formal living room with a built in library wall, great Catalina views, and an adjacent powder room. The family room is open to the dining area, and features a fireplace and access to the back patio. The warm kitchen comes equipped with a commercial size stainless steel range and gorgeous tile work. Upstairs, there are 2 additional bedrooms, each with a half bathroom. The upstairs bedrooms share access to a fully-tiled spanish style shower room. These rooms can be closed off from the rest of the house, as there is a separating door that can be locked, and a separate entrace from outside of the home. This could be a great income generator. On the other side of the large garage is a heated and cooled addition that can be an office, workshop, den, or guesthouse conversion. Step out into the beautiful covered patio, leading out into the pool and gardening area. Come. See. Stay!",

    "text":"This new construction 2,516 sq. ft. home is more than a style. Contemporary desert vernacular is an architectural language grounded in place, according to local architectural historian R. Brooks Jeffery, respecting the delicate Sonoran Desert environment, and incorporating time-honored design principles with contemporary interpretations that reflect the cultural characteristics unique to Tucson. Situated on .83 acres in the gated Quintana in the Catalina Foothills, this residence offers unmatched city and mountain views and a level of construction quality rarely seen in today's new builds. Designed by renowned architect Michael Franks and brought to life by La Quinta Building Company, this 2-bedroom, 2 1\/2-bath is being built to endure, featuring masonry construction with mortar-washed brick details and will be completed with steel casement windows and doors with dual-glazed high-efficiency glass. Inside, the finished home's spacious great room will showcase walls of glass, a beamed ceiling, and a carved limestone fireplace, seamlessly blending indoor living with the surrounding desert landscape. Scored, integral-color concrete floors flow throughout the home, complemented by custom alder wood and glass cabinetry and 8-foot solid wood interior doors, every detail carefully chosen to elevate the home beyond standard finishes. The gourmet kitchen will feature a generous center island, natural quartzite countertops, and a premium appliance suite including Sub-Zero, Wolf, and Cove. This home offers two primary suites, each with spa-like en-suites, which will feature quartzite tub decks, custom limestone tile and glass shower enclosures, and custom-designed walk-in closets with built-in organization. Additional features will include a fully integrated audio, visual, and security system, state-of-the-art mechanical systems and motorized shades in private areas. Outdoors, a brick driveway and courtyard entry, hand-forged wrought iron gates and railings, and professionally designed hardscape and landscape will create a striking first impression. The expansive rear porch captures panoramic city and mountain views. This single-level home exemplifies architectural integrity and enduring quality, designed as an extension of its natural surroundings creating harmony between architecture and nature. Located just minutes from premier golf courses, country clubs, and world-class dining and shopping. Scheduled for completion in 2026.",

    "text":"Seller will counter or accept offers between $800,000-$850,000. Welcome to Camino Colibri, a rare Catalina Foothills offering where thoughtful design, flexibility, and sweeping views come together on a truly premium lot. Multigenerational living immediately comes to mind when touring this home. The ground living level is completely step-free, making it ideal for supportive living arrangements or extended family to live comfortably and independently on one level. This level also serves as a blank canvas and can be easily retrofitted to accommodate a kitchenette, creating the opportunity for fully independent living if desired. A private, no-step suite with its own exterior entrance functions beautifully as guest quarters or a caregiver residence, offering privacy, dignity, and ease of access. With three ensuite bedrooms, the floor plan is thoughtfully designed to balance connection and separation. A full-size office with a private entrance adds exceptional versatility, ideal for a home-based business, creative studio, or dedicated workspace. The home's artistic character is matched by its setting. Expansive Catalina Mountain, city light, and sunset views unfold from a remarkable 1,000-square-foot entertaining deck, creating an elevated indoor-outdoor experience that would be difficult to replicate today at this value. Extensively updated by current ownership, the property blends beauty with function, featuring an extra-deep garage, a separate RV garage, and lush, mature landscaping with diverse plantings and established trees. All of this is just minutes from Banner Medical, fine dining, shopping, and the best of the Foothills lifestyle. Camino Colibri is more than a home. It's a long-term solution and a rare opportunity to secure views, flexibility, and lasting value.",

    "text":"This brand-new, 3,421 sq. ft home is more than a style. Contemporary desert vernacular is an architectural language grounded in place, according to local architectural historian R. Brooks Jeffery, respecting the delicate Sonoran Desert environment, and incorporating time-honored design principles with contemporary interpretations that reflect the cultural characteristics unique to Tucson. Situated on .88 acres at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac in the gated Quintana in the Catalina Foothills, this residence offers unmatched city and mountain views and a level of construction quality rarely seen in today's new builds. Designed by renowned architect Michael Franks and brought to life by La Quinta Building Company, this 3-bedroom, 3 1\/2-bath home was built to endure, featuring masonry construction with mortar-washed brick details along with steel casement windows and doors with dual-glazed high-efficiency glass. Inside, the spacious great room showcases walls of glass, a beamed ceiling, and a carved limestone fireplace, seamlessly blending indoor living with the surrounding desert landscape. Scored, integral-color concrete floors flow throughout the home, complemented by custom alder wood and glass cabinetry and 8-foot solid wood interior doors, every detail carefully chosen to elevate the home beyond standard finishes. The gourmet kitchen features a generous center island, natural quartzite countertops, and a premium appliance suite including Sub-Zero, Wolf, and Cove. This home offers two primary suites, each with spa-like en-suites featuring quartzite tub decks, custom limestone tile and glass shower enclosures, and custom-designed walk-in closets with built-in organization. Additional features include a fully integrated audio, visual, and security system, state-of-the-art mechanical systems and motorized shades in private areas. Outdoors, a brick driveway and courtyard entry, hand-forged wrought iron gates and railings, and professionally designed hardscape and landscape create a striking first impression. The expansive rear porch captures panoramic views of sparkling city lights and the surrounding mountain ranges. This single-level home exemplifies architectural integrity and enduring quality, as an extension of its natural surroundings creating harmony between architecture and nature. Located just minutes from premier golf courses, country clubs, and world-class dining and shopping.",

    "text":"Welcome to ''Casa de los Pelicanos'', a magnificent Foothills estate like no other that exudes timeless old-world charm and understated elegance from the minute you arrive and will captivate you at every turn. This home has a strong pedigree, owned & cherished over the past 60 years by only two well-respected prominent families; each known for their refined taste in art & design and love of the desert southwest which is evident everywhere you look. True to its roots, this home also embodies the Old Foothills lifestyle to perfection. Situated at the end of a long circular gravel driveway on an exceptional cul-de-sac view lot, the home is embraced by the breathtaking Catalina Mountains, with the iconic 'Finger Rock' framed perfectly in view, and mature desert landscaping accentuated by rock lined pathways meandering throughout the property which lead to the natural arroyo & wildlife corridor below giving you a sense of total privacy and a deep connection with nature. As you enter the home, you are welcomed into the foyer by the original hand crafted arched double doors and is showcased by an antique grand piano, beautiful original art and mahogany French doors leading to the rear terrace. The inviting living room features floor to ceiling windows framing the impressive views, a mesquite mantled fireplace, beamed ceilings and beautifully preserved original concrete tile floors. The spacious primary suite is a 5-star private retreat with a romantic fireplace, cozy reading area, luxurious bathroom w\/spa tub, huge walk-in closet with custom walnut built-ins, glass French doors and a wall of windows looking out at one of the most enchanting backyards in all of Tucson. Designed for outdoor living & entertaining, the home features luxurious al'fresco living spaces, charming intimate patios and lush mature landscaped grounds complete with a bi-level black bottom pebble-tec pool & newer top of the line spa- an oasis that evokes the spirit of Santa Barbara or San Miguel de Allende. Inside the home, you will find a library lined with mesquite bookcases and hand carved wood shutters, three spacious guest suites sure to please the most discriminating family or guests along with magnificent hand carved doors throughout. The kitchen features newer stainless appliances, hand painted tiles & was designed for a diva who didn't like to cook. It's cozy and charming but the space could be expanded into something spectacular if the chef in you so desires. The home is filled with quality antiques, original artwork and authentic antique Navajo rugs that have all been curated over the years to create a magical feel that would be hard to ever duplicate again. This is a rare, once in a lifetime opportunity to purchase this home \"turn-key\", fully furnished as you see it. What would normally take decades to achieve can be had as a package deal and you only need bring your suitcase and checkbook! This home is range priced from $3,250,000 unfurnished to $3,500,000 with all furnishings, artwork and accessories included. Don't miss this extraordinary opportunity to own one of the finest homes ever to be offered in the 'Old Foothills'. Its convenient location in the heart of the Foothills makes this home close to world class golf, shopping and dining- only a short 10 min drive to UA, & 5 min to La Encantada and La Paloma C.C.",

    "text":"Behind a private gate and situated on over six acres, this estate stands as a testament to Josias Joesler's architectural imagination. Thick adobe walls, hand-formed and enduring, rise against the desert sky, while clay tile roofs and smooth white plaster walls give the home a presence that is both timeless and grounded. The landscape feels inseparable from the architecture: courtyards, patios, and terraces are carefully composed to catch light, frame views of the Catalina Mountains, and draw the desert inside, where every room has a sense of connection and flow. Walking through the grounds, there is a feeling of quiet discovery, as if the house reveals itself gradually, its history embedded in the weight and texture of its walls. Inside, the estate is defined by material richness, with hand-troweled plaster and exposed wood beams introducing warmth, texture, and rhythm, while custom millwork and artisan-crafted details articulate the hand of the maker. Terracotta tile flooring stretches through the principal rooms, grounding the interior in an organic dialogue with the desert beyond. Decorative tiles, subtly placed, punctuate hallways, kitchens, and baths, offering moments of craftsmanship and tactility that hint at the house's romantic revival lineage. Light is treated as a design element: carefully positioned picture windows and walls of glass frame the mountains and courtyard, drawing in the changing moods of the day and allowing interiors to shift from intimate sanctuary to luminous gathering spaces. The kitchen is both functional and expressive, a space that feels naturally central. A generous island of polished stone, streaked with striking blue-green veins, commands attention without overwhelming, while custom wood cabinetry balances warmth and refinement. Glass-front display units provide lightness, and pendant lights in aged metal and glass introduce moments of rhythm and presence, echoing the lines of the exposed beams above. Here, cooking, conversation, and quiet reflection coexist seamlessly; the room feels alive yet grounded, a space built for everyday life as much as for entertaining. Living and dining areas continue this interplay of openness and intimacy. Interiors flow directly to patios, covered porches, and outdoor rooms, blurring the boundaries between inside and out. Each transition is deliberate, each threshold designed to frame a view, offer shade, or create a pause. The pool sits within a broad natural stone terrace, providing ample room for lounging and dining, while pergolas with substantial wood posts, built-in seating, and outdoor kitchens establish zones for gathering. Desert-adapted plantings, mature trees, and careful landscaping create privacy and serenity, making the grounds feel simultaneously expansive and protected. The estate feels like a world of its own, a desert sanctuary where space and tranquility define every moment. Yet this sense of seclusion is perfectly balanced: within minutes, the city's most vibrant experiences are at your doorstep. La Encantada's boutique shopping and fine dining, midtown's cafes and galleries, and downtown Tucson's cultural heartbeat are all just moments away. Here, the rare intimacy of private desert living coexists effortlessly with immediate access to the city's best amenities, creating a balance that transforms everyday life into something both serene and effortlessly connected.",

Rich with Spanish and Mexican design accents, this charming and well-flowing 2,513 sq. ft. home offers three bedrooms plus a living room with dining area, and a family room. Enter the residence through a welcoming courtyard with a fountain, a circular staircase ascending to an observation deck with sweeping city and mountain views, and an inviting front porch beneath a chinked mission-tile roof leading to a designer iron front door - capturing the true character and charm of Tucson living. The oversized 19' x 30' living room features engineered wood-grain flooring, a grand chandelier in the dining area, and access to the north facing covered patio providing exceptional space for entertaining. The comfortable family room offers a wood-burning fireplace, exposed adobe walls, and a high beamed ceiling with hand-crafted corbels. Light and bright, the remodeled kitchen offers slate countertops, stainless steel appliances, a farmhouse sink, a walk-in pantry\/laundry room, and a breakfast area that opens seamlessly to the covered west-facing patio. The office\/third bedroom showcases exposed burnt-adobe walls, an en-suite bathroom, and built-in cabinetry. The primary suite features a remodeled designer bathroom with dual sinks and a walk-in closet. The oversized 2-car garage provides abundant storage options. Additional guest parking and access to three community pools further enhance this exceptional offering! Property may not be purchased as a rental.

    "text":"You will be awed by the striking design of this modern residence, where architecture and landscape exist in perfect harmony. Nestled within the prestigious double-gated sanctuary of Pima Canyon Estates, this 5,900 sq. ft. single-level home commands breathtaking city lights, dramatic Arizona sunsets, and majestic views of the Catalina Mountains. From the first approach, the custom glass entry door hints at what's inside: a space where clean lines, natural materials, and organic light define every room. The courtyard with a sculptural water feature sets the tone, leading guests through a tranquil transition from desert silence to architectural brilliance. Inside, an open-concept great room with soaring ceilings and a stone fireplace anchors the space. Large expanses of glass create walls that reveal panoramic mountain vistas. The living, dining, and kitchen areas flow effortlessly together, designed for large-scale entertaining. The chef's kitchen offers top-of-the-line appliances, double ovens, a smooth electric cooktop, and a built-in wine refrigerator - designed for both culinary precision and social connection. An immense granite island invites guests to gather, with modern custom cabinetry with clean visual lines. Adjacent is a casual breakfast area overlooking the pool terrace and mountain views dotted with majestic saguaros. This residence offers five ensuite bedrooms, each designed for comfort and privacy. The primary suite is a bespoke retreat, complete with a jetted soaking tub, dual LED-lit vanities, a walk-in rain shower opening to a glass-framed garden courtyard, and a custom walk-in closet. The second primary suite includes an impressive stone fireplace, a media room or lounge area, a custom walk-in closet, an in-suite beverage center, a rain shower, a jetted garden tub, and a private terrace entry near an outdoor fireplace ideal for guests or multi-generational living. Step outside, and the home's connection to nature deepens. The resort-style backyard feels like an extension of the interior - a stage where the desert performs nightly. A custom pool and spa with architectural lighting create ambiance long after sunset. The built-in outdoor kitchen includes a BBQ, refrigerator, and ice maker, plus a rooftop view deck perfectly positioned for sunset dinners or entertainment. Multiple covered verandas and private seating alcoves provide space to unwind, entertain, or simply listen to the desert's quiet rhythm, viewing ancient saguaros, some centuries old. Beyond its visual artistry, this estate delivers the ease of turnkey luxury. Offered fully furnished, every piece - from the designer sofas to the curated art that's been chosen to complement the architecture and desert palette. Smart-home technology, four fireplaces, an oversized three-car garage, and energy-efficient systems ensure both comfort and sustainability. As day fades, the Catalinas blush pink, then violet, then indigo, and the home glows softly from within - where every evening feels like a private premiere, every moonrise a moment of awe.",

    "text":"You will be awed by the striking design of this modern residence, where architecture and landscape exist in perfect harmony. Nestled within the prestigious double-gated sanctuary of Pima Canyon Estates, this 5,900 sq. ft. single-level home commands breathtaking city lights, dramatic Arizona sunsets, and majestic views of the Catalina Mountains. From the first approach, the custom glass entry door hints at what's inside: a space where clean lines, natural materials, and organic light define every room. The courtyard with a sculptural water feature sets the tone, leading guests through a tranquil transition from desert silence to architectural brilliance. Inside, an open-concept great room with soaring ceilings and a stone fireplace anchors the space. Large expanses of glass create walls that reveal panoramic mountain vistas. The living, dining, and kitchen areas flow effortlessly together, designed for large-scale entertaining. The chef's kitchen offers top-of-the-line appliances, double ovens, a smooth electric cooktop, and a built-in wine refrigerator - designed for both culinary precision and social connection. An immense granite island invites guests to gather, with modern custom cabinetry with clean visual lines. Adjacent is a casual breakfast area overlooking the pool terrace and mountain views dotted with majestic saguaros. This residence offers five ensuite bedrooms, each designed for comfort and privacy. The primary suite is a bespoke retreat, complete with a jetted soaking tub, dual LED-lit vanities, a walk-in rain shower opening to a glass-framed garden courtyard, and a custom walk-in closet. The second primary suite includes an impressive stone fireplace, a media room or lounge area, a custom walk-in closet, an in-suite beverage center, a rain shower, a jetted garden tub, and a private terrace entry near an outdoor fireplace ideal for guests or multi-generational living. Step outside, and the home's connection to nature deepens. The resort-style backyard feels like an extension of the interior - a stage where the desert performs nightly. A custom pool and spa with architectural lighting create ambiance long after sunset. The built-in outdoor kitchen includes a BBQ, refrigerator, and ice maker, plus a rooftop view deck perfectly positioned for sunset dinners or entertainment. Multiple covered verandas and private seating alcoves provide space to unwind, entertain, or simply listen to the desert's quiet rhythm, viewing ancient saguaros, some centuries old. Beyond its visual artistry, this estate delivers the ease of turnkey luxury. Offered fully furnished, every piece - from the designer sofas to the curated art that's been chosen to complement the architecture and desert palette. Smart-home technology, four fireplaces, an oversized three-car garage, and energy-efficient systems ensure both comfort and sustainability. As day fades, the Catalinas blush pink, then violet, then indigo, and the home glows softly from within - where every evening feels like a private premiere, every moonrise a moment of awe.",

    "text":"Not merely a residence, this is a cultivated desert sanctuary, an architectural composition of form, light, and landscape nestled within the private secondary gates of Pima Gardens in the highly coveted enclave of Pima Canyon. Encompassing 6,631 square feet, with 5,667 square feet in the main residence and 939 in a detached guest house, the estate embodies a disciplined yet expressive design language where material authenticity, spatial clarity, and an enduring dialogue with the Sonoran landscape define its essence. The arrival sequence is choreographed through a privately gated courtyard, where sculpted plantings, a Cantera stone water feature, and textural accents establish a sense of journey and anticipation. Beyond the threshold, a soaring 16-foot foyer reveals travertine flooring, birch-paneled ceilings, and knotty alder beams punctuated with recessed lighting a composition that balances grandeur with warmth, and volume with intimacy. From this axis, the home unfolds in a deliberate rhythm, each space aligned to capture light, frame the Catalina Mountains, and embrace the sculpted gardens beyond. The formal living room is anchored by expansive walls of glass that dissolve boundaries between interior and desert, welcoming soft northern light to animate surfaces and finishes. A climate-controlled wine gallery with 900-bottle capacity, along with a dining area that transitions seamlessly to terraces, enhances the home's capacity for both private repose and convivial gathering. At the heart of the home, the chef's kitchen functions as both instrument and aesthetic. Dual islands, bespoke imported cabinetry, and granite surfaces are complemented by professional-grade appliances, anchoring a space designed for both performance and gathering. Adjacent, the informal living room centers on a Cantera-faced fireplace, offering a warm counterpoint to the formal living areas. A breakfast nook opens to its own private patio, oriented toward a desert wash where rock outcroppings and saguaro-studded terrain frame the view, a setting for quiet rituals and easy connection to the landscape. A dedicated theatre, wrapped in straw-knit wall covering for texture and acoustic depth, creates an intimate cocoon for cinematic experience. The primary suite is conceived as a retreat of serenity, sequestered within the western wing, with custom alder-and-birch starburst ceilings that create the foundation of the space, while a two-way fireplace connects the sleeping chamber to an intimate sitting room. Doors extend outward to a private owner's suite terrace, framing long views of desert horizons. Additional en-suite bedrooms carry forward the same architectural rigor, attentive to proportion, material richness, and natural illumination. A detached guest residence completes the composition, offering full independence with its own kitchen, living area, fireplace, and a private terrace for guests. Outdoors, the estate unfolds as a layered sequence of experiences, where architecture and landscape are inseparable. Expansive Cantera verandas and hardscape extend the living spaces outward, their geometric lines softened by carefully placed specimen Yucca brevifolia, punctuating the desert landscape with living sculpture. A centerpiece of the exterior composition, is a one-of-a-kind Cantera water feature that anchors the landscape, with handmade stone spheres, each releasing a veil of water from its crown, cascading in quiet rhythm before merging with the negative-edge pool and spa that seem to dissolve into the desert horizon. Broad terraces flow into courtyards and an outdoor chef's kitchen, while sliding glass walls spanning 20 feet vanish entirely, blurring boundaries between interior precision and desert vastness. On the lower tier, a turf expanse offers an unexpected plane of green within the desert palette, extending opportunities for play, gathering, or repose. Light, shadow, and meticulously framed sightlines choreograph the outdoor experiences, creat",

    "text":"Set within The Canyons, the pinnacle of Catalina Foothills living, this 1.49-acre ridgetop homesite is one of the last true premier land offerings in Tucson's most exclusive guard-gated community. Elevated and gently sloping, it offers a highly buildable envelope-a rare advantage in a mountainside setting where many remaining lots are defined by steep terrain and expensive site work. Here, the topography works for you. The natural pad easily supports a single-level luxury residence of approximately 6,000 sq ft, allowing you to invest in architecture and finish rather than heavy excavation. Orientation and elevation combine to capture unobstructed Catalina Mountain views, open Sonoran Desert vistas, and a dramatic sweep of city lights after dark. The generous 1.49-acre footprint provides true estate-scale flexibility: room for courtyards, pool and spa terraces, outdoor kitchens, and multi-car garage-all while preserving the privacy, quiet, and low-density feel that define The Canyons. Despite its seclusion, the location sits just minutes from La Encantada's dining and boutiques, La Paloma's golf and club amenities, and the Finger Rock and Ventana Canyon trailheads, placing the best of the Foothills within quick reach. With its combination of views, usability, and ridgetop position, this parcel stands out as one of the last highly buildable, estate-caliber homesites of its kind-an exceptional canvas for a legacy foothills estate in The Canyons.",
