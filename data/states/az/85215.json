    "text":"This is the kind of home that feels special the moment you pull into the cul-de-sac. Tucked away on one of the largest pie-shaped lots in Red Mountain Ranch, this 4 bedroom, 2 bathroom home backs directly to the 8th hole of the golf course and offers rare privacy with no neighboring homes looking in. With 15,568 square feet of land, sweeping fairway and mountain views, and a setting that feels peaceful and open, it's easy to forget you're still close to everything Mesa has to offer. Inside, the heart of the home is the beautifully remodeled kitchen, thoughtfully expanded to nearly double its original size. A grand island anchors the space, offering abundant storage and room to gather, cook, and entertain. Vaulted ceilings and a wood-burning fireplace create a warm, inviting living area that feels both dramatic and comfortable. Travertine flooring runs throughout the living area of the home with no carpet anywhere (wood in bedrooms), and all appliances are included, making this home truly move-in ready. The backyard is where this property truly shines. A massive 30 by 60 pool, recently refreshed with resurfaced deck, sits perfectly within the oversized lot, offering endless room to relax, entertain, or simply enjoy the quiet golf course setting. Recent roof replacement adds peace of mind for years to come. Living in Red Mountain Ranch means access to a highly desirable community with parks, walking paths, playgrounds, tennis courts, and a strong sense of neighborhood pride. Homes with this level of privacy, lot size, and golf course frontage rarely come available. This is not just a home, it's a lifestyle opportunity.",

It has the space, the flow, and the layout everyone wants, but almost nobody can find in this part of town. The sellers took care of this place the right way. Every system, every upgrade, every detail was kept in top shape. You can walk in and feel it right away. No surprises, no hidden issues, just a well kept home. The location speaks for itself. You're in one of the most wanted pockets with quick access to shopping, dining, top schools, and easy freeway access that makes daily life simple. It's close to everything, but still feels quiet and private. If you've been waiting for the right home instead of settling, this is the one you look at. Homes like this move fast because they check all the boxes in a market where most don't.",

    "text":"Nestled within a gated enclave of elevated custom homes, this modern farmhouse-inspired residence is enriched with subtle European character and timeless architectural detail. Completed in 2018, the home welcomes with a whitewashed brick exterior and gracious courtyard entry, accented by bold architectural lighting, thoughtfully layered landscaping, and ideal north\/south exposure. An arched iron-and-glass front door anchors the facade, blending timeless European character with refined modern appeal. Inside, herringbone-patterned wood-look tile floors, soaring ceilings, and graceful brick-lined arches establish a sense of warmth and distinction, setting the tone for thoughtfully curated interiors throughout. Featuring carefully curated walls adorned with custom wainscoting, walls, every inch of the home has been masterfully detailed. Tall windows with plantation shutters and designer window treatments frame the living room, while tasteful wall coverings, brushed wood beams, brick-lined accent walls and modern farmhouse chandeliers create an inviting environment for refined entertaining and everyday comfort. The great room features a charming breakfast nook and a welcoming family room with custom built-ins, wood-beamed ceilings, and a striking fireplace that anchors the space. Open to the gourmet kitchen, the layout offers a seamless connection between gathering spaces and enhances the home's natural flow. Set on an impressive 36,000-square-foot irrigated corner lot, the property offers exceptional outdoor space and flexibility rarely found in this setting. A large paved driveway and custom RV gates provide access to covered backyard parking, with ample room to add a guest home, RV garage, or additional amenities. Green space is abundant with lush lawn space, mature citrus, and productive lemon trees that enhance the grounds with both beauty and function. The backyard is designed for resort-style living and entertaining, featuring a dramatic and newly built 9.5-foot-deep diving pool with heated spa, LED lighting, and water features. Travertine pavers extend the living and entertaining space, while an extraordinary outdoor kitchen and seating area designed for true culinary entertaining is anchored beneath a long-lasting aluminum ramada with cafe lighting, misting system, and automatic shade screens. A generous sit-up bar accommodates outdoor dining and gatherings, complemented by a Wolf built-in barbecue, ice chest, Mongolian grill, wok or oversized gas burner, and a show-stopping gas fireplace that creates a warm and inviting atmosphere year-round. The farmhouse-inspired kitchen blends soft white cabinetry with rich, deeper wood tones, creating a warm yet refined aesthetic. Honed quartzite countertops in a richly colored palette provide striking contrast, while the substantial mitered-edge island anchors the space and makes a bold design statement. A black Blanco sink, brushed black hardware, and coordinating light fixtures add a modern edge. Gourmet appliances include a Thermador gas range with griddle and burners, a professional chimney-style range hood framed by a brick facade, a GE Monogram French-door wall oven, and a built-in microwave. An ideal mix of open shelving and well-planned storage completes this highly functional and beautifully appointed kitchen. A private front office features a custom iron-and-glass door that allows diffused light while maintaining privacy. With a walk-in closet, the space offers flexibility as a home office, guest suite, or optional fifth bedroom. The owner's suite is a serene retreat, highlighted by refined horizontal wall paneling, a tray ceiling with rope lighting, and a dedicated sitting area. The en-suite bath is styled in elegant finishes and features quartz countertops, dual vanities, a soaking tub, stylish lighting, and a walk-in shower, and a private water closet with bidet. A spacious walk-in closet is smartly designed with added pull-down clothing racks for enhanced functionality.",
