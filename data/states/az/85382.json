Karen Lee Ln., Peoria, AZ 85382 In the year 2006 I started reconstruction of my 1499 sq ft double wide Mobile Home with an addition I parked my motorhome in the backyard, added all the hook ups, and then gutted the interior of the existing home, removed everything from the interior out to the insulated aluminum siding and then remove all flooring and ceiling materials. I installed a brand new water and waste water system below the floor and central air conditioning with ductwork in the ceiling. Additionally, in the ceiling and down the walls a brand new to code electrical system, including, cable TV connections in all rooms, including the kitchen, interconnected smoke alarms, and GFI's in all wet areas. I redesigned the floor plan removed one of three bedrooms to provide a master bedroom with a full walk-in closet with double lighting, and all close hanging appliances. I reconfigured the kitchen and installed maple cabinets with updated automatic drawer shutting devices with reastatic lighting in all stain glass cabinets and kitchen ceiling, I converted the house to all electric, eliminating gas service, electric including the hot water heater installed in the basement. This was done so that I could heavily insulate all the outer walls and inner walls for soundproofing and an economic environment. When finished heavily insulating all walls, I then covered all walls and ceiling with 5\/8\" sheet rock for fireproofing. I installed double pane, low E, argon filled windows being the most energy efficient on the market at the time. Before I reconfigured the floor plan, I provided exterior three-quarter inch five ply plywood in the floor over the entirety of the double wide when finished with the molding throughout the entire entirety of the house. I installed a stain resistant mold-free beige colored carpet throughout. In the kitchen and family room I installed pergola flooring and in the bathroom ceramic tile. In 2008 I tar papered the entirety outside walls of the mobile home then applied half inch exterior plywood over the entire exterior walls including upper extremities that look like Santa Fe style appendages. Then tar papered, chicken wired and then stucco the entire exterior, of the modular home. on the ends of the home I provided 12 vega tails to add to the southwest appearance to the home. I installed GFI circuits 6 foot in height on all exterior walls. In 2010 I placed a new driveway for eight cars. I placed curbside curbing along the street according to what the city does for a gradual incline curbing and drainage. I installed a pony wall, Santa Fe style around the front of the property and landscaping with drip irrigation, low-voltage lighting and desert landscaping stone when all the plantings were completed. In 2011 I did the front patio using 12 inch diameter tree post in the Santa Fe style. The same year I did the back patio in the same fashion. Both roofs over the patios are the entirety of the mobile homes 42 feet. The front patio is 8 feet off the building. The back patio is 12 feet off the building both Santa Fe style. 2012 I had patio brick work completed for the entirety of my back patio. 2014 I installed drip irrigation piping, throughout the entirety of the property with eight separate low-voltage control zones. All my landscaping was to be desert landscaping. 2016. I upgraded the electrical system to a 200 amp service requiring changes to my electrical system, electrical upgrade included basement, swimming pool, water heater, and a solar panel upgrade on the pa",

    "text":"With a fresh price and exceptional condition, this Santa Barbara model is an incredible opportunity in Westbrook Village. The kitchen was recently remodeled with quartz countertops, freshly painted two tone cabinets, a classic white subway tile backsplash, new undermount sink and modern faucet, giving the heart of the home a fresh, updated feel. The spacious and functional layout includes vaulted ceilings, separate living and family rooms, a formal dining area and an eat-in kitchen nook, ideal for both entertaining and everyday comfort. The seller uses the home just a couple of weeks per year and maintains it meticulously, and it shows throughout the high end wood look porcelain plank tile flooring and overall condition. The backyard features a sparkling PebbleTec pool with water feature, enhanced by a 2023 Pentair heating system for true year round enjoyment. In 2024, the entire pool filter system was replaced for optimal efficiency. A unique detached bonus room sits just off the back patio, accessible by three exterior doors. This room is not connected to the interior of the home, making it perfect for a home office, art studio, workshop, hobby space, fitness room or secure storage for patio and pool items. It also includes a dedicated wall AC unit for comfort. Additional updates include a new roof in 2019, refreshed pool decking in 2022, updated ceiling fans and garage storage cabinets. Westbrook Village offers an exceptional active adult lifestyle with two 18 hole championship golf courses, heated pools, a fitness center, pickleball, tennis, arts, crafts and more, all conveniently located near shopping, dining and freeway access.",
