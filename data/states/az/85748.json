    "text":"Multi-Generational Home! Discover a rare and versatile opportunity with this updated 5 bed\/2 bath East Tucson property, remodeled in 2025 to include a fully equipped 2nd kitchen\/dining area and interior door that creates 2 distinct living spaces. Current floorplan offers 2 Units with 2 bedrooms and 1 bath each, with their own private backyard. An ideal floorplan to enjoy living on one side while generating rental income or hosting guests or tenants in the other. Or as a multi-generational family home, where both sides will appreciate their privacy, but can easily come together to spend quality time with each other. If a traditional 5 bedroom\/2 bath floorplan is preferable, the 2nd kitchen can be removed and converted back to the primary suite. Originally remodeled in 2018, the main unit blends modern style and thoughtful craftsmanship and contemporary finishes. The expansive main kitchen showcases a large granite island for casual dining, and stainless steel appliances. Custom light fixtures, recessed lighting, and a charming wood-burning fireplace flanked by floating shelves, elevate the home's ambiance, creating spaces that are both warm and sophisticated. Thoughtfully designed and recently completed by a licensed contractor, the second kitchen features stainless steel appliances, granite countertops, modern cabinetry, and luxurious wood look tile flooring, offering the same level of quality and style found throughout the main living space. Durable ceramic tile flooring spans the common areas, while plush carpeting in the bedrooms offers comfort underfoot. Each bathroom is appointed with granite countertops and ceramic tile shower surrounds, ensuring a luxurious yet durable finish. Ceiling fans, dual pane windows, and strategically placed skylights enhance natural light and energy efficiency. Outside, the home continues to impress. The main rear yard is perfect for outdoor entertaining with a fire pit, paver patio, artificial turf, flower beds, sail shades, and beautiful mountain views. In addition to a second rear yard, the property features a storage room off the carport and a dedicated dog run. The roof was recoated (2024) a new hot water heater installed (2024), and HVAC (2018), offering peace of mind. With its modern amenities, unique and flexible layout, and extensive upgrades, this turnkey property is ready to welcome its next owner. Don't miss this exceptional opportunity to experience the endless possibilities this contemporary haven has to offer.",

    "text":"WELCOME to 1710 S. Kevin Drive! A one-owner home that's been lovingly cared for and it shows. Built in the mid-1970s, this property sits in a quiet, established Eastside neighborhood close to shopping, restaurants, grocery stores, and bus service, yet feels peaceful and private with mountain views in the distance. The home offers 4 bedrooms and 2 baths with a comfortable layout that flows. The updated kitchen has stainless steel appliances, plenty of cabinet space, and a large peninsula that opens right into the dining area. The living room features recessed lighting, classic wooden shutters, and a cozy fireplace. Both bathrooms have been refreshed, including a newly tiled master shower. The Arizona room spans the entire back of the house, ideal for entertaining, hobbies, or simply enjoying the sunlight. There's also a large laundry room with extra storage plus two Tuff sheds, one 10x20 with a skylight and another 10x15 set up as a workshop or hobby space. Notable updates include a newer roof, freshly painted trim, and a neutral interior repaint. The home has Pella windows and patio doors in the master and dining rooms, with triple-pane windows throughout the rest of the home for added efficiency. It's an all-electric home, complete with wrought-iron security on all windows and doors for extra peace of mind. Outside, you'll find a new 13-ft wooden gate with alley access, perfect for RV parking or room for toys, and a backyard with space to create your dream pool. The semi-circle driveway adds to the curb appeal and convenience. If you've been searching for a well-cared-for Eastside home with updates, storage, and room to make it your own, this one's it!",

    "text":"It's rare to find a patio home that balances mountain views with this level of meticulous care. From the moment you step into the private, gated courtyard, you can feel how well-maintained this space is. It's the kind of home that makes a great first impression and then keeps delivering. The great room features a stunning wall of windows that perfectly frames the Catalina Mountains. With two full primary suites, the floor plan offers a level of privacy and flexibility that's hard to come by. The interior and exterior have been beautifully maintained and lightly lived in. You'll also find ceramic tile, vaulted ceilings, and a cozy wood-burning fireplace. The home is equipped with newer dual-pane Low-E windows and no polybutylene piping. Plus, the freestanding finished garage... more is one of the few in the neighborhood. French doors lead from the dining area to a beautifully landscaped, north-facing backyard--perfect for enjoying the Tucson air without the direct heat of the afternoon sun. The location is just as convenient as the home itself, putting you minutes away from local shopping, dining, and transit while tucked away in a quiet, tree-lined neighborhood.",
