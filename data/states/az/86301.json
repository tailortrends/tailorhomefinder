Take a hike to this lot that was meant for development in the 70s. There is no road to traverse, but look for the sign at the edge of the road on Hilltop Circle. Find your lot, mark the coordinates, and own a piece of history. *All electric in the community is overhead, but off-grid might be the only way to go with this land.*",

We have heard that both sewer and water are available at the street, but you should investigate\/research if this will be a lot for building, Unit 2 in Granite Gardens allows for both manufactured and site-build homes, so use your imagination and get that steel home on the lot before someone else snaps up this beauty!

    "text":"A Landmark 1901 Georgian Revival Estate. Rich in history and architectural distinction, this exceptional 1901 Georgian Revival residence was built by Richard E. Sloan, Arizona's last Territorial Governor. Serving until Arizona achieved statehood, Governor Sloan's legacy is woven directly into this remarkable home-an enduring cornerstone of Prescott and Arizona history. Set on two downtown lots totaling over one-third of an acre, just minutes from Prescott's iconic Courthouse Plaza, the property offers rare scale, privacy, and presence within the Historic District. Spanning 4,137+ square feet, the residence includes multiple bedrooms and 3.5 baths, thoughtfully arranged across multiple levels, and is complemented by an oversized detached 2+ car garage, originally constructed as the home's carriage house. The architecture is unmistakably Georgian Revival. A classic hipped roof with decorative balustrade surrounding a central roof deck, two-story pilasters, classically detailed eaves, and three original fireplaces establish symmetry and stately proportion. Inside, original hardwood floors, millwork, and wall treatments reflect the craftsmanship of the era. A grand dual staircase, illuminated by a custom stained-glass window, anchors the welcoming foyer. The main level offers a formal parlor, expansive entertaining room, and gracious gathering spacesrooms once host to notable social events and Territorial-era meetings. Authentic period functionality remains intact, including servants' quarters with a private stairway to the kitchen, a rare and highly prized historic detail. The upper levels continue the story.

    "text":"A Landmark 1901 Georgian Revival Estate.Rich in history and architectural distinction, this exceptional 1901 Georgian Revival residence was built by Richard E. Sloan, Arizona's last Territorial Governor. Serving until Arizona achieved statehood, Governor Sloan's legacy is woven directly into this remarkable home--an enduring cornerstone of Prescott and Arizona history.Set on two downtown lots totaling over one-third of an acre, just minutes from Prescott's iconic Courthouse Plaza, the property offers rare scale, privacy, and presence within the Historic District. Spanning 4,137+ square feet, the residence includes multiple bedrooms and 3.5 baths, thoughtfully arranged across multiple levels, and is complemented by an oversized detached 2+ car garage, originally constructed as the home's carriage house.The architecture is unmistakably Georgian Revival. A classic hipped roof with decorative balustrade surrounding a central roof deck, two-story pilasters, classically detailed eaves, and three original fireplaces establish symmetry and stately proportion. Inside, original hardwood floors, millwork, and wall treatments reflect the craftsmanship of the era. A grand dual staircase, illuminated by a custom stained-glass window, anchors the welcoming foyer.The main level offers a formal parlor, expansive entertaining room, and gracious gathering spaces--rooms once host to notable social events and Territorial-era meetings. Authentic period functionality remains intact, including servants' quarters with a private stairway to the kitchen, a rare and highly prized historic detail.The upper levels continue the story. The second floor hosts multiple bedrooms and baths, while the third-floor livable attic, originally designed as a children's playroom, features reinforced beams and flooring intended to support early gymnasium equipment and even dancing--an uncommon and delightful detail of the time.Respectfully maintained with modest updates that honor its heritage, this legacy estate stands as a beautifully preserved example of Early Colonial American architecture and Georgian Revival elegance. Homes of this caliber--offering architectural integrity, historical significance, and a premier downtown setting--are rarely available.A rare opportunity to own an irreplaceable piece of Prescott's and Arizona's history--now thoughtfully repositioned for today's discerning buyer.",

This lot has so much potential and is facing South South West so sun exposure on those cold days. Seller decided not to build at this elevation. His loss is your gain. Owner is willing to carry for the right offer. Drive by and take a look. If this one is not perfect let me know, I have more.",

    "text":"How often does 4.25 acres come available on Rosser? Not much open space left on Rosser and this parcel is situated in the middle of Prescott Lakes, Blooming Hills, Estancia De Prescott, Eagle Ridge, Cliff Rose etc. and only minutes from town. No subdivision, so no HOA's, how cool is that? Build your dream home and have plenty of insulation from neighbors or if you are a builder-investor you can split and have several lots, zoned SF-35, in the heart of Prescott, with city utilities, you decide. This is a rare opportunity to get over 4 acres in the heart of Prescott, they are not making anymore land, so come and get one of the last remaining chunks in Prescott. WELCOME HOME!",
