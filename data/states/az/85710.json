    "text":"Tucson Association of Realtors Home Tour Winner!! Welcome to this midcentury modern ranch that blends modern design with thoughtful updates that honor its 1960s character. Once part of the 1961 Tucson Parade of Homes, the P.A.T. Homes ''Yorkshire'' plan remains a classic. Inside, original mahogany paneling and expansive sliding glass doors connect the indoors to a private backyard and a front courtyard. The kitchen retains its retro charm with cabinetry featuring grain-matched wood doors, original turquoise oven, quartz counters, and modern stainless slide-in range, dishwasher, and refrigerator. Updates include a newer roof, 200-amp electrical panel, and pex water line between the meter and the home. Walkable to schools, the Ott Family YMCA, and a neighborhood park. This home beautifully balances midcentury spirit with modern comfort.",
