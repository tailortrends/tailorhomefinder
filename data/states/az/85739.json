With a chicken coup already in place and a fully fenced in yard. That is just the beginning of what this property has to offer. You will enjoy this 4 bed 2 bath home with mountain views. With a newer AC unit from 2022 and a ROOF from 2021 have peace of mind knowing the big ticket item have already been taken care of. The washer and dryer are also only 3 years old and stay with the home. Pipes were done in 2017.",

With a chicken coup already in place and a fully fenced in yard. That is just the beginning of what this property has to offer. You will enjoy this 4 bed 2 bath home with mountain views. With a newer AC unit from 2022 and a ROOF from 2021 have peace of mind knowing the big ticket item have already been taken care of. The washer and dryer are also only 3 years old and stay with the home. Pipes were done in 2017.",

Located in Catalina at Black Horse Ranch in Northwest Tucson, this easy-care home offers relaxed desert living with neighborhood sidewalks and nearby open spaces. The 3-bedroom, 2-bath split floor plan is designed for comfort, privacy, and effortless flow. Two secondary bedrooms are set in their own wing, ideal for guests, family, or a home office. The primary suite enjoys its own private wing and functions as a true retreat, featuring a spacious bedroom, double vanity, walk-in closet, walk-in shower, and garden tub-perfect for unwinding after a hike or a day on the golf course. At the heart of the home, a generous kitchen opens to the main living area, with dark oak cabinetry, glass-door accents, a built-in wine rack, granite slab countertops, stacked-glass backsplash, and an island with barstool seating. A formal dining room connects to an adjoining den or office with double French doors, offering flexible living space. Both front and back yards feature low-maintenance xeriscape landscaping. The pristine backyard includes a patio accented with pavers, fruit trees, including lemon, and a block wall for added privacy.

    "text":"This cul-de-sac weapon delivers privacy, views, and leverage...all in one tight, efficient package. 3 bedrooms. 2 bathrooms. 1,033 square feet of space that actually works. The gated courtyard isn't decorative.... its a statement. Private. Secure. Intentional. Out front, a mature oak tree (perfect for climbing) sets this home apart from the cookie-cutter desert builds surrounding it. You don't buy character like this..it already exists! The heavy lifting is done. HVAC and bedroom carpet updated in 2021. Solar slashes summer utility bills when everyone else is bleeding cash. This home doesn't need saving; it needs an owner with vision and the confidence to finish strong. If you understand upside, location, and long-term return, this is where you move.",

Five garage parking spaces provide exceptional flexibility for vehicles, storage, or a dedicated workshop, a feature rarely available without compromise. The 2068 sqft main house has 3 beds and 2 baths with vaulted ceilings, abundant natural light, an enclosed front courtyard, fire sprinklers throughout, and a whole house water filtration system. Built in 2018, the detached 414 sqft guest house sits above the detached garage, has 1 bed and 1 bath with true separation for guests, extended living, or a short term rental. This property is NOT in an HOA. The backyard is fully enclosed by a newly constructed masonry stucco wall, preserving privacy while maintaining the incredible views.",

    "text":"Welcome to your private wellness sanctuary, tucked away in a small enclave of homes on the grounds of MIRAVAL Resort in Tucson, AZ. This residence and this lifestyle are distinctly different. Here, you hit the pause button and recharge. With the amenities of a world class destination spa at your doorstep, it's easy to do. Created by the forward-thinking minds at MITHUN of Seattle, this home intentionally feels subdued from the approach, while offering a powerful experience upon entering. Blending with the earth and honoring the desert were top of mind for a sustainable build. Awarded Silver LEED status from the Green Building Council, the property integrates materials, textures and colors that speak to the surrounding landscape. Seamlessly blending indoors and out, with unobstructed views of the Catalina Mountains, this setting invites you to relax, breathe and connect with nature. Layers of the desert unveil themselves as light moves throughout the day. This is truly a place that allows the mind to clear and opens space for creative thoughts. A thoughtful layout offers the ability to comfortably host guests or delineate spaces for different functions. The 2400 sq ft main house includes the primary suite, guest bedroom, guest bath and great room flowing to an expansive patio from which you feel completely secluded. With a gas fire pit, infinity plunge pool with swim jets and outdoor daybed, this area adds substantial living space to the home. A 700 sq ft detached casita provides a private setting for guests with separate living and rest spaces, ensuite bath and courtyard with a jetted spa. Homeowners and their guests may choose to immerse themselves in the experiences at MIRAVAL as little or as much as they desire. The resort has created an environment in which a wellness journey is completely individual and offers a robust variety of facilities, services, and activities. A sampling of offerings includes spa treatments, fitness classes, yoga, meditation, hiking, mountain biking, equine therapy and horseback riding, lectures, culinary classes, and spiritual sessions. With on-site dining, concierge and transportation services, everything needed is at your fingertips. A unique and easy to own asset, this property would work beautifully as a vacation home, seasonal residence, or corporate retreat. There is the option to rent the property through the resort-managed rental program when unoccupied, if desired.",

Located off a short section of dirt road, this peaceful setting has a bit more of a rural feel to it, partly due to the quite large 1.80 acre lot. While some site preparation may be necessary to build this lot up, the lower price point allows for this additional site prep. Electric lines are to the lot. Enjoy being just a minute away from Saddlebrooke itself, nearby to city amenities, and NO HOA fees or CC&R restrictions. Minor deed restrictions.",
