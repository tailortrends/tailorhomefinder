This stunning single-story ranch offers over 2,400 sq. ft. of refined living space, featuring a smart master-split floor plan, 5 bedrooms, and 2 updated baths.

Over $150,000 in recent owner improvements include a remodeled kitchen, updated bathrooms, water heater and appliances. Step outside to an 18,000 sq. ft. lot that feels like a resort. Whether you are cooling off in the pebble diving pool, cooking at the built-in BBQ and bar, or relaxing by the fire pit, this home is built for entertaining. With RV parking and a charming courtyard shaded by a mature olive tree, this is the opportunity you've been waiting for.",

The kitchen is designed with function in mind, featuring stainless steel appliances, ample cabinet space, and new countertops with large island. Out back, the private backyard is set up for both fun and relaxation, with a sparkling pool that's perfect for cooling off during Arizona summers, hosting friends, or just relaxing. An RV gate provides added flexibility for storing recreational vehicles, trailers, or extra gear, while the 2-car garage offers secure parking and additional storage space. The primary bedroom provides a quiet place to unwind, complete with a walk-in closet and an updated bathroom that's practical and easy to maintain. Additional bedrooms offer flexible space for kids, guests, or a home office, allowing the home to adapt as your needs change.

    "text":"Welcome to Star of Paradise, the most architecturally-distinct enclave of homes in the Sheaborhood. This James B. Jeffries 'Starlight Home' captures the soul of mid-century modern design while offering a reimagined floorplan and new-century, tech-forward features. The home's sprawling modern elevation is defined by a low-sloped roofline, exposed rafter tails and block construction with stone accents, built-in planters and modern mailbox monument. Set on a North\/South-facing lot, this home is tucked away from major streets. Enjoy desert-adapted front landscaping, a spacious 2 car garage and expanded slab parking with RV gate access to the rear yard. The warm welcome begins with a low-walled front courtyard, which leads to the entry. This home checks a lot of boxes: cool architecture, rad neighborhood, 4 bedrooms with split primary suite, 2 bathrooms, 2 car garage, pool, upgraded home security AND self-sustaining, high-level-engineered solar system \/full-house battery storage (house can be fully-powered by battery back-up system). Substantial improvements reflect a commitment to comfort and sustainability, including remodeled kitchen and baths, upgraded flooring, dual pane windows and doors, upgraded sleeved sewer lines, new roof '21, new 200amp electrical panel and new HVAC + ductwork '16. The interiors are enriched with a thoughtful blend of modern and contemporary elements paired with premium materials throughout. A gracious formal entry unfolds into expansive living and dining spaces, where durable Oak wood-look tile floors create a sense of visual continuity. The spacious living room is anchored by French doors that open seamlessly to the rear yard, inviting natural light and effortless indoor-outdoor connection. Sleek, modern finishes elevate the kitchen into a beautiful space to cook, create, and gather. Completely reimagined, it functions as both a welcoming social hub and a true culinary workspace, blending clean design with effortless practicality. Enduring finishes include classic white raised-panel cabinetry, solid quartz counters, glass tile backsplash, and stainless steel appliances featuring a gas range\/oven, dishwasher and built-in microwave. A double-door pantry sits just off the kitchen and there is ample room to add a kitchen island, if desired. Entertaining is seamless with a formal dining room located adjacent to the kitchen, where French doors open directly to the rear yard. A casual dining area offers additional flexibility and can easily serve as a secondary living space. The home offers 4 comfortable bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, each finished with a modern, timeless sensibility. Looking for a split primary suite that welcomes peaceful rest and relaxation?! The newly-created primary suite (once a living space) is a true retreat with vaulted ceilings, plush carpet, ceiling fan, European-style wardrobe and gorgeous natural light from 3 dual pane windows that are set on the cedar wood + exposed block accent wall. The primary bath continues the refined aesthetic with a slate tiled shower + jetted tub with frameless glass enclosure, hexagon tiled floors, electric toilet bidet, floating vanity with extended cabinetry, skylight, vaulted ceiling and contemporary fixtures. The secondary rooms all feature vaulted ceilings, dual pane windows, plush carpet and ceiling fans. The hall bath is also fully-remodeled featuring a slate-tiled shower + tub with rain head + shower wand, inset product niche and frosted glass shower panel along with a skylight and floating vanity with vessel sink + smart mirror. Both bathrooms are pre-plumbed and wired to accommodate bidet installations, with hot and cold water lines and nearby electrical outlets. Thoughtfully engineered and exceptionally capable, this is a tech-forward home that supports efficiency and resiliency. Designed to support modern living and high-performance work-from-home needs, the energy system goes far beyond typical solar installations. A roof-mounted Enphase 15 kW",

    "text":"Located in Paradise Gardens, one of the only Phoenix neighborhoods designed by renowned architect Al Beadle, this fully renovated Cholla Model represents a rare opportunity to own an authentic example of mid-century desert modernism. Built in 1959, the home preserves Beadle's original architectural vision while integrating thoughtful modern updates. The residence offers 2,328 square feet with 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a dedicated office, and a private swimming pool. Original design elements include terrazzo flooring, rammed earth construction, breeze block walls, stacked glass, and steel fascia detailing. The home has been fully renovated with careful attention to maintaining its architectural integrity. The Euro-style kitchen features a waterfall island, modern cabinetry, and clean-lined finishes that align with the home's minimalist design language. Bathrooms have been updated with spa-inspired materials and fixtures. Lutron automated shades provide seamless light control throughout the living spaces. Interior and exterior finishes have been refreshed, and the pool has been resurfaced. The property includes a carport and sits approximately 0.5 miles from Shea Boulevard, about 1 mile from SR-51 access, and near the new Paradise Valley Mall redevelopment featuring Whole Foods, Sephora, Trevor's Liquor, and Flower Child. Central Phoenix, Paradise Valley, and Scottsdale destinations are easily accessible. Homes in Paradise Gardens are infrequently available, particularly those that retain original Al Beadle design elements alongside modern renovations. This property offers a rare opportunity to own a historically significant mid-century residence in a neighborhood recognized for its architectural pedigree.",

Steps to hiking\/biking trails & quick access to stores, restaurants, the SR-51, Downtown & the airport. In a neighborhood where remodeled homes command $2.5M-$4M, this is a RARE CHANCE to buy right, design smart & unlock significant upside.",

    "text":"This home was completely reimagined, permitted and thoughtfully executed. There's a certain calm that comes from knowing everything just works. New systems. New infrastructure. Just confidence, peace of mind, and freedom to enjoy living. Vaulted ceilings and clean sightlines frame sweeping mountain views you experience from the living spaces themselves-not from a drone. The split floor plan lives effortlessly. A gourmet kitchen with a walk-in pantry anchors the open floor plan. The primary suite is quiet and restorative with a soaking tub and microcement shower. An oversized laundry adds a pet wash and everyday function. An outdoor shower is there when you need it, and direct access to the half bath. Unlacquered brass fixtures add warmth and intention throughout... Set in Heritage Heights with rare privacy, quietly tucked at the base of the Phoenix Preserve, this is a tight-knit neighborhood people don't want to leave. Virtually everything is new. This is one you want to experience fullyin person.",

    "text":"Perched near Paradise Valley's finest amenities on the northern edge of the Phoenix Mountain Preserve, this 2021 architectural gem crafted by acclaimed architect Bradley Edwards, is more than a home: it's a sculptural expression of modern design, serenity, and seamless integration with nature. Originally conceived as a private creative retreat for a photographer, this over 4,000 sq ft residence commands more than an acre of pristine desert terrain with direct access to hiking trails and unobstructed views of iconic Piestewa Peak. Inside, clean lines and dramatic volumes define the space. Polished exposed aggregate concrete floors, 12-foot ceilings, and floor-to-ceiling Fleetwood retractable glass walls create a fluid connection between indoors and out effortlessly merging light, landscape and architecture. The heart of the home is built for gathering and entertaining, with dual chef-grade kitchens one inside, one alfresco featuring sleek quartz counters, custom white oak cabinetry, and top-tier smart appliances. Five bedrooms and 3.5 bathrooms provide luxurious space for family and guests. Step outside to a private oasis with a resort-style pool, spa, and expansive rooftop decks that capture golden sunsets and panoramic mountain views. With no HOA restrictions and ample space to expand, this estate is the perfect canvas for your vision. This is desert modernism at its most refined, offering absolute privacy, architectural prestige, and proximity to everything including world class dining, shopping, hiking and golf.",
