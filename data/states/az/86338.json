    "text":"Private High-Desert Oasis - Off-Grid Living with Endless Possibilities Tucked away in its own secluded valley and surrounded by dramatic granite boulders, this 40-acre hideout offers unmatched privacy, natural beauty, and the freedom of off-grid living. Once a thriving organic farm, the land is rich with potential, having previously produced a variety of grapes and vegetables. At an elevation of 4,400 feet, the climate is ideal-mild and comfortable across all four seasons-making it perfect for sustainable living or a peaceful retreat from the hustle of city life. The main residence is a thoughtfully designed 1,150-square-foot, two-bedroom, one-bath home built with 12-inch AAC block walls, providing excellent insulation to keep it cool in the summer and warm in the winter. Inside, the open living space features stained concrete floors, a cozy wood-burning stove, and gas appliances. A spacious 800-square-foot covered porch invites you to relax and take in the stunning natural surroundings. Just a short walk from the home, you'll find a wood-fired hot tub - an ideal place to unwind under the stars.

Set in a serene high-desert landscape, the land offers a rare combination of privacy, natural beauty, and usable space-perfect for building a custom home, creating a retreat, or establishing a hobby ranch. The property includes multiple improvements, such as a large multi-car garage suited for storage, workshop use, or equipment housing, as well as a carport and detached well house. The previous home area features an existing concrete foundation\/basement, offering an existing footprint to jump-start your future construction. Electricity was run to the previous home-site underground but buyer to investigate electricity with APS. Powerlines run along the property line. 2 wells on site, drill records available for both. Septic is existing, although non-functional. The grounds provide ample room for RV parking and space for gardens, animals, or additional structures. With its rugged rock formations, 4 mild seasons, and panoramic vistas, this is a unique opportunity to own land that blends tranquility with endless potential. Whether you're seeking a peaceful getaway or a place to create your dream compound, this property delivers the perfect canvas.",
