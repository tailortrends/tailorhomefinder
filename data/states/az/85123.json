    "text":"This large, cul-de-sac lot offers a great opportunity to build a home that is not only HOA-free, but also removed from through-traffic. It offers plenty of space for a great yard while also near amenities. Utilities are available at the roadway. It is located less than one hour from Phoenix, Arizona, and 10 minutes from I-10. Lots of this size and features rarely become available at an affordable price for either a residential or investor. Visit the property's Land Tour 360 for an interactive viewing experience!",

    "text":"If you've been waiting for a home in Arizona City that gives you space, upgrades, and the feeling of a desert retreat - 11023 W Malibu Circle delivers. Tucked into a cul-de-sac just south of Paradise Lake, this 4-bed, 3-bath home feels like your own little hideaway. Nearly 1, 800 sq.ft., thoughtfully laid out, with room to spread out or come together. The split systems - two air conditioners + two water heaters - keep life comfortable all year long. The roof is only 2 years old, and the solar system is completely paid off, adding huge value and low monthly utility costs. Step into the backyard and you'll understand why people fall in love with Arizona City: mountain views from the patio, fully landscaped grounds, and a storage shed ready for tools, hobbies, or toys plus no HOA!",
