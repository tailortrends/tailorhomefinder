    "text":"HAPPY NEW YEAR, WE ARE BACK. Starting 2026 off right with a price improvment for you. Some homes brag about ''updates.'' This one brings receipts. Total invested by the owners? $336,296. And it shows the second you pull up. Welcome to a property where pride of ownership wasn't a slogan - it was a lifestyle. Every year, these owners reinvested into the home, not because something broke... but because they believed in making it better. Stronger. More enjoyable. More valuable. This is the kind of listing buyers beg for but rarely find. Step Inside ,The Transformation Is Immediate Open the door and the upgrades greet you instantly: refreshed floors, updated paint, newer carpets, a modernized layout, and natural light pouring through,all-new energy-efficient windows (2023, $32,000). The kitchen? Completely reimagined in 2023 with a $55,000 remodel, featuring premium finishes and a layout built for real life, not builder-grade compromises. The family room's custom feature wall + fireplace installation (2023, $27,000) turns the main living area into a luxury focal point you simply won't see in nearby resales. This home has a flow, a warmth, a presence and it isn't an accident. Even privacy and comfort received premium upgrades with whole-house shutters ($20,000), layered lighting improvements, and fresh mechanical systems throughout. Outdoor Living This Backyard Would Cost $500K+ To Recreate Today If the interior sells the home, the backyard seals the deal. This outdoor space wasn't \"maintained.\" It was *built intentionally, professionally, and with long-term value in mind. Here's what buyers feel the moment they step outside: A retiled pool patio (2020, $6,000) built for gatherings, sunsets, and actual living. Stack stone accents front and back ($16,500) framing the yard like a custom resort. New palms (2023, $5,900) delivering instant luxury. Fake grass (2021, $4,200) that stays green without the water bill. Outdoor LED lighting ($3,500) that makes the yard glow every night. Three outdoor speakers + Sonos amp (2023, $1,550 total) turning the patio into its own experience. Pool heater (2022, $3,500) for year-round swimming. Back and bedroom screen doors so indoor-outdoor living is effortless. And yes if someone were to hire contractors today to build this exact yard, it would push half a million dollars. Easy. This isn't a backyard you \"enjoy.\" It's one you remember. The Big-Ticket Items? Already Done. Buyers hate surprises the expensive kind. This home removes that fear completely: Two new AC\/heating units (2022, $26,000) New roof + full underlayment (2022, $14,000) Whole-house window replacement (2023, $32,000) Brand-new master bathroom remodel (2025, $67,201)absolutely stunning Upgraded irrigation (2025, $1,900) New garage door opener (2025) Multiple water treatment systems (2021-2022) These are the upgrades buyers pray for when shopping. Here, you get them all at once. A complete update list will be provided to buyers the full breakdown of everything poured into this property. No guessing. No half-truths. No hidden issues. The Secret Advantage: Cave Creek Address, Scottsdale Convenience This property sits in one of the most financially strategic pockets of the Valley. You're literally minutes from Scottsdale, yet your mailing address and more importantly, your tax footprint sits in Cave Creek. That means: Lower taxes Lower overall cost of ownership A quieter, less congested community feel Buyers relocating from Scottsdale often don't realize how big the savings are until they compare the numbers side-by-side but once they do? They move here for a reason. You're getting the Scottsdale lifestyle without the Scottsdale cost. And in 2025, that difference adds up to hundreds of thousands of dollars over the life of ownership. This home is the smart move financially and emotionally. --- A Home Built for the Next Owner, Not the Last Many resales come with excuses: \"They were going to fix it.\" \"They meant to remodel someday.\" \"They plan",

PRIME N. Scottsdale location, with Cave Creek address, just inside the border of the county island. Beautiful unobstructed views of Black Mtn., this exceptional lot provides huge feasibility for various additions, and sits only two driveways from the end of pavement to the property. Far enough from Scottsdale Rd to prevent road noise, yet walkable to the Target\/Safeway ''Summit'' plaza. And... unincorporated with NO HOA, affords maximum versatility and high value rental income potential - exempt from the constraints of HOA or City restrictions. This one is truly a 'standout' oozing with pride of ownership.",

    "text":"There is a rare sense of arrival here. Set on a quiet street in Tatum Ranch, this Cave Creek residence reflects years of thoughtful stewardship, where updates were made with intention rather than urgency, and every improvement was chosen to support the way life truly unfolds inside its walls. Drenched in natural light, and grounded in a quiet sense of ease, this home wraps you in love from the moment you walk in. The kitchen, remodeled in 2020, sits at the heart of the home and is complemented by a custom built-in banquette breakfast nook. Waterproof vinyl flooring added the same year flows throughout the main living areas, bringing both durability and warmth. Recently added GE appliances, including a range and microwave installed in 2023 and a dishwasher added in 2025, support the natural rhythm of everyday living. A beautifully remodeled laundry room and storage throughout add quiet layers of ease. The essentials that matter most have been handled with care, including a new roof in 2018, full exterior paint in 2020, and two brand-new A\/C units installed in 2024, ensuring comfort and peace of mind through every season. This thoughtfully designed floorplan offers four bedrooms and two and a half bathrooms. The primary bedroom, tucked behind French doors, features a generous walk-in closet and an en suite with a separate shower and soaking tub, dual vanity, and private water closet. A spacious secondary bathroom offers a dual vanity with a separate, privately enclosed bathing area. Step outside and the experience expands. With no neighbors behind, you're met with coveted privacy and open natural desert views. In 2023, the pool was fully resurfaced and the space thoughtfully reimagined with turf, a generous covered patio that functions as an outdoor living area, beautiful pavers, and a built-in BBQ, creating a setting designed for connection. A two-car garage with storage and workbench is paired with an extended driveway for ample parking. Surrounded by parks, golf, and the easy pace of Cave Creek living, this is a home that needs no convincing, ready to be lived in and loved.",

Tile throughout all the main traffic areas and open plan that provides an expansive feel while having spaces for formal dining and a den. The kitchen is filled with abundant hard wood cabinets, granite and high end appliances. The island is large enough to seat 8 and it opens to a large great room filled with windows and views to the pool and natural desert behind. The way this home sits N\/S with a slight turn provides max sun defense and tremendous energy efficiency. The back yard has multiple area to enjoy (a finished covered patio, waterfall play pool sited to provide lush grass and finally a relaxing outdoor fireplace) One of the nicest communities in Cave Creek, Lone Mountain!

    "text":"Scottsdale? Sedona? Played out. Cowboys? They're in. Even Post Malone went country! Don't forget that when you're looking for your next short-term rental or vacation home. And if country is what you want? Well, it doesn't get any more country than downtown Cave Creek. This 2025 build sits on the closest lot to downtown, walking distance to Big Earl's, Frontier Town, Buffalo Chip, art galleries, and much more. Perfect elevation allows for sweeping views of the town of Cave Creek, Black Mountain, Elephant Mountain, and the most special Arizona sunsets you will ever witness. Floor-to-ceiling windows let you observe all of this from your air-conditioned living room. Pool, fire pit, motorized blackout shades, and detached two-car garage round out the amenities. With no HOA, its prime location within Cave Creek, and all furniture included: this home is practically begging to become a short-term rental. Older properties on less accessible lots gross $10K\/month before expenses. But you just might like it so much that you keep it all to yourself!",

    "text":"Stone Ranch is a rare Cave Creek estate where luxury living meets the untamed beauty of the Arizona desert. A walled estate with two gates and direct access to approximately 3 million acres of protected land, this 5 bedroom 5 bathroom private retreat offers unmatched seclusion, panoramic mountain views, and dazzling sunsets - yet remains just five minutes from downtown. The 6901 sq ft main residence blends the spirit of the West with refined sophistication, featuring a grand living room, a western-inspired saloon, a media room, a subterranean speakeasy, art gallery and flex space. Throughout the home, thoughtful craftsmanship reveals itself in unexpected ways, including custom millwork concealing multiple hidden doors, an intentional nod to Old West design, where the finest details are discovered, not displayed. A beautifully appointed 1617 sq ft guest house mirrors the quality and intention of the main residence, offering endless views and proven income potential. Outdoor living rivals a private resort, complete with a negative-edge pool, swim-up ramada, elevated waterfall spa, and multiple fire features set against a dramatic mountain backdropperfect for sunset gatherings and long desert evenings. For automotive enthusiasts three attached garages provide 2821 sq ft of space to accommodate up to 14 vehicles with lifts, ideal for car collections, recreational vehicles, and outdoor gear. Adventure truly begins at your doorstep, with direct access to over 900 miles of hiking and horseback riding trails, making the surrounding desert a seamless extension of the property. Set on more than 3 acres with NO HOA, Stone Ranch includes an additional flat acre, ideal for a private stable, expanded recreation, or whatever the land inspires. This is more than a home, it is a legacy property crafted for those who value space, privacy, and living life in luxury without limits.

Irreplaceable at this price!!! SEE MORE IN SUPPLEMENT. Desert Modern Architecture: Nestled on a five-acre slope in Cave Creek, the Hidden Valley Desert House is a \"long pavilion for living\" designed by Wendell Burnette FAIA. This exceptional home features superb materials, detailed construction, and a unique plan, making it a masterwork of living design. The design, seemingly straightforward, surprises with its details: From the ground, the home is anchored on a solid plinth with stepped, local concrete masonry walls and a monolithic hand-applied plaster-style coating. Above, a large shade canopy appears to float, offering shelter. The upper roof canopy features a deep, mill-finish stainless steel fascia that screens solar panels and mechanicals, echoing the landscape and sky. Approaching the home, a concrete stepped path leads to a dramatic gathering space. Water features are on the west, with ponds, while the east includes a fire-pit for cool desert nights. Solar orientation and photovoltaic panels make this home eco-friendly. Generous living is abundant here. The main level includes a chef's kitchen with a coffee nook, opening to an outdoor gathering space. The great room features a dining area and built-in A\/V wall. An intimate space includes a fire feature and wine column, converting to an outdoor patio-room. A hidden transition wall reveals a private meditation room with a view of the Koi pond shared with the Owners Suite. The Owners Suite opens outdoors, keeping the bath and sinks secluded. A Japanese-style bath includes a wood soaking tub and handmade wooden sink. The plan offers three bedrooms plus extra exercise and office spaces, easily convertible for any needs. Guest rooms are on the lower level for privacy. The home includes a large protected pet run. Artfully sighted, the primarily south-facing home is surrounded by mature Saguaro, with a unique ecology featuring a teddy bear cholla field to the east. The home is elevated for sweeping views from the Phoenix Valley to the south, with the Continental Mountains to the east reflecting the sunset sky. Inside, the canopy's underside is dark like the night sky a deep soft shade and a continuous open feeling. Outside, a similar dark night sky wooden ceiling structure exists. The lowest level offers comfort, while the upper levels are open to views and earth, with doors and glazing creating a larger living space. When opened, there are often no distinctions between inside and outside. A subtly rich material palette includes \"shadow reflective finishes\" of cold-rolled mill finish steel, ebonized sustainable MDF, three dark finishes of sustainable resin-infused paper, colored felt wall panels, and integral color purple-black hand-applied stucco walls with embedded vermiculite. The Japanese concept of \"Wabi-Sabi\" is embraced, celebrating new and old, rich and diverse textures. Built to a high level of craft, this home is irreplaceable at this price. The architect's statement encapsulates the home's serenity and harmony: \"For our clients, this house was about purging\/simplifying their life and also about an indoor\/outdoor house for their Koi, Rhodesian Ridgebacks, and one cat and their very specific way of living.\" We are certain you'll find this home",

The home features consistent tile flooring throughout, curated accents, contemporary fixtures, and exceptional lighting enhanced by a whole-home Lutron system. Generous gathering spaces and a flexible floor plan provide both openness and privacy, ideal for a variety of lifestyles. Expansive stacking glass doors connect the interior to generous paver patios, outdoor entertaining areas, and beautifully landscaped desert grounds. Surrounded by wide skies, desert terrain, and the distinctive character of Cave Creek, offering a setting that feels both connected and removed. This residence was created for buyers who value architecture, light, and thoughtful detail over passing trends. The builder's European background in electrical design is evident in the home's layered, balanced lighting, creating an atmosphere that feels intentional and composed from day to night. The floor plan offers flexibility and privacy, including a secondary ensuite bedroom well suited for guests or multigenerational living. A striking glass-and-iron front door anchors the arrival experience, opening from a private front courtyard that sets a dramatic yet welcoming tone. The kitchen is both refined and highly functional, centered around a large island and featuring stacked cabinetry, a sleek backsplash with concealed outlets, built-in refrigeration, beverage fridge, appliance garage, and pot filler...all designed to keep surfaces visually clean and streamlined. The primary suite offers a well-appointed space with a dual-entry walk-in shower, soaking tub, and a generous walk-in closet with an in-closet washer and dryer for added convenience.

Traversing the hillside on a beautifully paved road you can clearly see the artful design of the entire property. The level of quality in all the details is very apparent everywhere you look. The chefs kitchen, the Pella windows and doors and counter surfaces that adorn the custom cabinets show the effort the owners took to create this masterpiece. The living space and kitchen area greet you as you enter the front door. All 3 of the generous bedrooms are situated on the second level to capture the views. This is a must see if you want to be close to all that Cave Creek offers and still feel like you are on your own private retreat. Please take time to watch the video. Pool concept in photo",
