    "text":"Range priced $585,000-$600,000. Timeless Mid-Century Modern Gem on Nearly an Acre in Casa Adobe Estates. Inspired by the legendary designs of Tucson's most influential mid-century architects-Arthur T. Brown, Anne Rysdale, Nicholas Sakellar, Robert Swaim, Bernard Friedman, and the master of burnt adobe himself, Tom Gist-this exceptional 3-bedroom, 2-bath home is a rare find that artfully bridges past and present. Situated on a flat and usable 0.86-acre lot, this burnt adobe beauty stands as a tribute to Tucson's architectural heritage. Meticulously preserved and thoughtfully reimagined, the home retains the defining features of the original classic home but has been updated to the living standard of 2006. This is a ''MUST SEE'' home. You could not build this home for this price. Sparkling pool, plenty of storage, RV and boat space available. You will love the huge updated kitchen with stainless steel appliances.",

    "text":"Rarely does a home come up in historic Casas Adobes, a walkable neighborhood just around the corner from Whole Foods and a myriad of restaurants. Architecturally it is a classic adobe home ripe for renovation. I especially love the wood ceilings, the wood beams, and a fireplace with a nod to mid century modern. The outdoor living is truly special. Imagine sitting on the front porch enjoying the mountain views.The backyard living with an inviting pool, complete privacy, and multiple patio options. This home is nestled in an area known for a deep connection to nature. Here, you can live close to it all while feeling a world away. While some areas could benefit from updating, the layout, incredible outdoor settings and desirable Foothills location creat a fantastic foundation. Thoughtful improvements will not only enhance everyday living but also add significant long term value, making this property a smart and rewarding investment in one of Tucson's most sought after neighborhoods.",

The 3-bedroom, 3-bath main residence is complemented by a private 1-bedroom, 1-bath guest casita with full kitchen-ideal for guests, multigenerational living, or a private studio.Built in 2007, the main home showcases exposed wood beam ceilings, painted interior adobe brick walls, polished concrete floors, 8' alder doors, custom wood columns, and two authentic beehive fireplaces with designer tile accents. A warm, cohesive palette blends natural wood, earth tones, and soft plaster finishes. Thoughtful upgrades include custom Roman shades, an office with built-in cabinetry, a spacious laundry with extra refrigeration, tankless gas water heaters, whole-house water softener, interior\/exterior fire sprinklers, and zoned Trane HVAC with gas heat (replaced 2023). The chef's kitchen was fully renovated in 2024 by acclaimed Tucson designer Marina Luz of LCM Interiors and features custom walnut cabinetry, honed quartzite countertops, designer tile backsplash, plastered range hood, oversized 9' island, walk-in pantry, Sub-Zero refrigeration, Wolf 6-burner gas range, built-in Thermador oven and microwave, wine refrigerator, and built-in ice maker.

It includes an open living\/dining area, full kitchen, polished concrete floors, recessed lighting, ceiling fan, laundry, storage, and a private outdoor shower enclosed by stucco walls with city views. Outdoor living is equally impressive with covered patios, wood beam detailing, a cantera stone fountain courtyard entry, outdoor beehive fireplace, stainless steel BBQ, synthetic turf installed 1\/2026, and resort-style pool re-plastered in 2023 with new tile and warranty.

    "text":"Surrounded by desert on a 1.2-acre parcel with compelling views of the mountains and sunset-yet close to the city center and abundant amenities. 5445 N Yvon Heights Place is tucked away in a small, gated enclave of only 12 homes that blends modern living with surrounding historic charm. With open space on all sides, this lot is private, unique and highly desirable. Completed in 2025, the property is effectively brand new and has been thoughtfully enhanced by the owner. Entering through an oversized glass pivot door, there is clear visual of the Tucson Mountains to the west and Catalina Mountains to the east. Airy spaces with high ceilings are appointed with large format tiles, designer lighting, well positioned windows, and a beautiful blend of neutral tones. The split floor plan includes 3 spacious bedrooms (all with ensuite baths), along with a den, office\/flex space, and powder room. Whether the desired use is entertaining or a restful retreat, the layout is perfect for either. The great room seamlessly opens to the outdoor living area, which is truly magnificent. Everything to maximize desert life has been completed--the pool with a built-in fountain, silver travertine decking, gas firepit, synthetic grass area and the custom artistic metal panels. Extended fencing has created a huge yard, maximizing the views and offering unlimited potential. This exceptional residence blends two lifestyles--desert living and city living. Heading north, there are trailheads to access the mountain, high end retail and grocery shops. Heading south it's easy to access Downtown Tucson, the University of Arizona, major hospitals and all the unique eateries and museums found in the Old Pueblo.",

    "text":"Welcome to a beautifully preserved home full of character, warmth, and thoughtful modern updates-complete with a PebbleTec pool and full guest house. The main residence built in 1948 with 2,365 square feet is filled with natural light and timeless charm. A formal living room with large picture windows captures beautiful mountain views, while an inviting family room offers additional gathering space. The cheerful galley-style kitchen blends modern updates with classic character. Vibrant countertops add a fun pop of color, while the farmhouse apron-front sink, gas range, stainless steel appliances, and abundant cabinetry make the space both inviting and functional. The kitchen opens toward the dining area and family room, creating seamless flow throughout the main living spaces. The split layout includes three bedrooms and four bathrooms: a primary suite with private bath, a second ensuite bedroom with its own attached bath (ideal for guests or older kids seeking independence), a guest bedroom with nearby full bath, plus a powder room. There's also a flexible den\/bonus room and a bright sun room overlooking the pool perfect for morning coffee or peaceful afternoon reading. Through the front brick courtyard, mature desert trees create a private, shaded retreat with classic Tucson character. Moving toward the back of the property, a sparkling PebbleTec pool invites relaxation, dining, and outdoor living perfect for enjoying warm Arizona days and cool desert evenings. The detached guest house, built in 1926 with 354 square feet, is a full residence of its own, complete with a living area, cozy wood-burning fireplace, kitchenette, and updated bath ideal for guests, in-laws, a studio, or rental income potential. Both the main home and guest house were thoughtfully revitalized in 2014. The land itself is where the magic truly unfolds. With a small animal\/chicken pen, a separate storage\/workshop building featuring a rare original fruit cellar, ample parking, and wide-open acreage, you have space for hobby farming, gardens, RV parking, or future structures. And with no HOA, you have the freedom to use the property as you envision whether that means creating new outdoor spaces or simply enjoying the room to breathe. In the mid-1900s, this part of Tucson was home to vast citrus groves planted by rancher Reid. While the exact boundaries evolved over time, the surrounding area still reflects that legacy from its agricultural roots to the naming of Orange Grove Road. Today, this one-of-a-kind property carries the warmth, history, and character of that era while offering the comfort and possibilities of modern living. And although the setting feels peaceful and tucked away, you're still just minutes from Whole Foods, shopping, dining, and everything Tucson has to offer. CR-1 zoning on 2.68 acres allows for horses and small livestock, offering the space and flexibility to add future facilities if desired. This is more than a home it's a lifestyle. Space, history, flexibility, and Tucson convenience all in one rare package.",

    "text":"Timeless and evocative, 6727 N Pomelo Drive rises from the heart of Casas Adobes as a true desert estate-an extraordinary offering where classical Antebellum architecture meets the raw beauty, history, and cultural richness of Tucson. Set on approximately 7.55 acres of rare, usable land, this remarkable property represents one of the largest privately held residential parcels in the area. A private well nourishes the grounds, which feature more than 55 thriving citrus trees that create a fragrant, orchard-like oasis rarely found in the desert. With an expansive 7,784 square feet of interior living space, the home's stately presence, dramatic facade, and exquisite symmetry offer an architectural elegance seldom seen in the Southwest. Casas Adobes itself is one of Tucson's most storied and established luxury communitiesknown for its rolling desert landscapes, spacious lots, mid-century architectural heritage, and proximity to the Catalina Mountains. Long considered one of Tucson's premier residential enclaves, Casas Adobes offers a unique blend of tranquility and accessibility. Residents enjoy immediate access to luxury shopping, award-winning restaurants, boutique markets, golf, renowned spas, and cultural attractions like Tohono Chul Parkyet the neighborhood retains an air of peaceful exclusivity that feels worlds away from the bustle. The community's deep-rooted character, combined with mature vegetation and rich architectural diversity, provides a sense of timelessness that perfectly complements the estate's classical Southern grandeur. The city of Tucson further enriches the value of this estate, combining a nationally recognized food scene, world-class hiking, a thriving arts community, and a year-round outdoor lifestyle shaped by breathtaking natural beauty. Tucson's position as a destination for winter visitors, outdoor enthusiasts, medical professionals, snowbirds, and affluent second-home owners makes properties of this scale and versatility exceptionally desirable. The region's growing tech, aerospace, and academic sectorsanchored by the University of Arizona and major employersfurther support strong long-term real estate demand. The home itself offers exceptional potential for bespoke modernization. Its vast rooms, numerous bathrooms, and generous layout form the perfect canvas for crafting a refined, contemporary desert retreat or restoring its classic Antebellum charm. The estate's automotive facilities elevate it to a category all its own: in addition to a traditional three-car garage, the oversized RV and collectors' garage can accommodate no fewer than nine vehicles without liftsand many more with themmaking it an extraordinary opportunity for collectors, adventurers, or those who require substantial storage for luxury vehicles, equipment, or recreational assets. Beyond its architectural and residential appeal, the property offers immense investment and lifestyle versatility. Its acreage, privacy, and scale create opportunities that are virtually unheard of in central Tucson. For the discerning investor, possibilities include developing luxury guest casitas, creating a boutique wellness or retreat-style Airbnb compound, establishing a high-end event venue, or crafting a multi-dwelling estate for multigenerational living. With proper approvals, the land could support curated hospitality experiences, private gardens, equestrian facilities, or a destination-style vacation rental property capable of commanding premium nightly rates. The private well provides a valuable resource for large-scale landscaping and agricultural concepts, from expanded citrus production to curated desert gardens. Whether envisioned as a generational personal residence, a private desert sanctuary, an upscale income-producing retreat, or an extraordinary redevelopment canvas, 6727 N Pomelo Drive stands alone. Few properties combine this level of privacy, acreage, architectural presence, and proximity to Tucson's premier amenities. This is mo",

    "text":"You are invited to this Lovely location high up on a Hill. It captures spectacular mountain vista views, the green golf course across the street and Primo sunsets. You may want to park a chair either on the back patio or side yard to partake in the common Tucsonan past time of weather tracking, be it our famous storms or night sky's. The slump block architectural detail to this age restricted Town-Home community is unknown but was inspired by a visionary and built by Fairfield Homes (see posted history.) This 2 BR home has ''just enough'' space to every room, the kitchen features a unique slab counter top and cherry cabinets, the primary bedroom offers a walk in closet with sliding door access that offers views. Living here is a lifestyle that boasts luxury with a casual ease of living and community amenities. May I mention the 2 car garage with extra cabinet storage and epoxy floors, situated on a street that ends into hillside natural desert, and guest parking. Or the Foothills Mall being rebuilt down the street with every amenity needed or wanted. Venture over to see if this feels like the right place for you. Maybe you can see yourself here and add the TLC only you can provide.",
