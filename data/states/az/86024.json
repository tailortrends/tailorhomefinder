    "text":"There's something different about this place. Maybe it's the way the A-frame cuts into the sky just right. Maybe it's the way the light spills through the tall windows in the morning, or how the pine trees seem to wrap around the home like a well-kept secret. Whatever it is, it works! Sitting on a private corner lot in Tamarron Pines, this cabin leans into everything you love about being in the woods: quiet mornings, crisp air, and space to actually breathe. Inside, you'll find a wide-open living area with a stone fireplace that steals the show, a kitchen built for group meals and late-night snacks, and an upstairs loft that's just the right amount of tucked away. Bonus: the loft isn't just for looks, it comes with a full bathroom, too. Step outside and you're met with options, two covered decks for lounging in the shade or staying dry when the weather rolls in, and a big open deck perfect for grilling, stargazing, or doing absolutely nothing at all. It's laid-back, low-maintenance, and already proven as a successful Airbnb. You're also just minutes from national forest access, hiking trails, and endless outdoor recreation. Whether you're looking for an income-producing property or a place to unplug without sacrificing comfort, this one hits that rare balance of charm, function, and location. And it does it without trying too hard.",

    "text":"There's something different about this place. Maybe it's the way the A-frame cuts into the sky just right. Maybe it's the way the light spills through the tall windows in the morning, or how the pine trees seem to wrap around the home like a well-kept secret. Whatever it is, it works! Sitting on a private corner lot in Tamarron Pines, this cabin leans into everything you love about being in the woods: quiet mornings, crisp air, and space to actually breathe. Inside, you'll find a wide-open living area with a stone fireplace that steals the show, a kitchen built for group meals and late-night snacks, and an upstairs loft that's just the right amount of tucked away. Bonus: the loft isn't just for looks, it comes with a full bathroom, too. Step outside and you're met with options, two overed decks for lounging in the shade or staying dry when the weather rolls in, and a big open deck perfect for grilling, stargazing, or doing absolutely nothing at all. It's laid-back, low-maintenance, and already proven as a successful Airbnb. You're also just minutes from national forest access, hiking trails, and endless outdoor recreation. Whether you're looking for an income-producing property or a place to unplug without sacrificing comfort, this one hits that rare balance of charm, function, and location. And it does it without trying too hard.",

Hand-crafted rock fireplace set the tone for cozy mornings and firelit evenings. The kitchen blends rustic charm with modern ease thanks to stainless-steel appliances, while the flexible layout lets you choose your primary retreat on either level. Upstairs, the loft suite feels like a hideaway among the treetops, complete its own private deck made for stargazing. Step outside to the low-maintenance Trex deck and a handy storage shed, all framed by forest serenity. 24' * 34' detached garage\/workshop provides epoxy floors, a built-in sink, office\/workspace, and attic storage. This wooded setting delivers the authentic lifestyle with space to breathe.",

    "text":"Imagine Your Perfect Dream Cabin in the Heart of the Ponderosa Pine Forest-Perched at 7, 000 feet, this thoughtfully designed log cabin blends rustic charm with modern luxury. Nestled in the towering Ponderosa pines, it's the ideal retreat for those seeking both adventure and serenity. Step inside and be greeted by an expansive Great Room, complete with a stunning full rock-faced fireplace and unobstructed views of the forest. The space flows seamlessly into a gourmet kitchen, featuring a 48'' gas range with double ovens, pot filler, all-fridge\/all-freezer, granite counters and a spacious walk-in pantry. Whether you're hosting a large gathering or enjoying a quiet night in, this kitchen has everything you need to inspire your inner chef.... Perfectly designed for family and guests, the cabin offers 3 private bedroom suites each with its own bath and separate outdoor accesses, leading to the extensive decks. The oversized loft serves as a secondary gathering\/game space & sleep loft; complete with custom dual bunk beds with trundles providing sleeping for an additional 4. As expected, the loft allows an additional outdoor balcony for a beautiful heightened scenic view of the towering pines. The split primary bedroom is a sanctuary, offering his-and-her closets, a luxurious snail shower with dual heads, a soaking tub, dual vanities, and a private water closet with bidet features. Every detail in this cabin has been professionally curated with no expense spared. Soaring tongue-and-groove wood ceilings, custom lighting fixtures, and beautiful river rock accents highlight the cabin's rustic charm. Engineered hardwood flooring runs throughout the main living spaces, with plush carpeting in the bedrooms. Not to be overlooked, the oversized 3-car garage provides ample space for vehicles and gear, while the large utility room with folding space and sink adds convenience. Other notable features include a tankless water heater, central vacuum system, propane-powered fireplaces, and an outdoor fire pit perfect for chilly mountain evenings. The cabin is situated in the gated Pine Canyon Community, which offers year-round street maintenance and exclusive access to a clubhouse. The clubhouse boasts game tables (billiards, table tennis, shuffleboard, and foosball), as well as a library, kitchen, and cozy conversation spaces. This is the ultimate cabin retreatwhere rustic elegance meets modern convenience in the heart of nature.",
