    "text":"Welcome to 16319 E Jacklin Drive, a true luxury retreat in the hills of Fountain Hills, Arizona. This meticulously renovated 5-bedroom, 3.5-bath residence spans 4,700 square feet and showcases sweeping views of the canyon and Red Mountain from nearly every room. Perfectly positioned in a quiet, dark-sky community with no HOA, this home offers the ideal blend of privacy, sophistication, and everyday functionality. The heart of the home is a stunning, newly designed kitchen complete with granite countertops, stainless steel LG appliances, updated lighting, and custom cabinetry. A coffee bar and wine nook add extra touches of refinement. The adjacent dining and living areas are framed by floor-to-ceiling thermal windows and new patio doors that invite in natural light and panoramic desert views. Vaulted ceilings and a real stone gas fireplace create a warm, elegant ambiance, while new laminated wood flooring flows throughout the main level. The primary suite is a serene escape, offering direct patio access through two new doors and breathtaking canyon views. The completely remodeled en-suite bath is a showpiece, featuring a custom 8-foot shower with etched glass, oversized tile, dual vanities, granite countertops, and refined fixtures. Two additional guest bedrooms on the main level provide comfort and style - one with its own patio door that opens to a large deck overlooking the landscaped yard and ravine. On the lower level, you'll find two oversized guest suites with patio access, a large recreation room with a wood-burning fireplace, and a walkout to the pool and outdoor living area. Outside, the resort-style experience continues with a heated Pebble Tec pool, resurfaced and equipped with a new automated panel and bottom cleaner. A covered lower patio with a built-in stainless-steel BBQ makes for effortless entertaining, while the expansive backyard has been professionally redesigned with succulent gardens, 25 palm trees, artificial turf, tranquil walkways, and new exterior lighting. The front courtyard is stunning with a custom wrought iron chandelier and artisan-crafted double doors. Additional features include a raised garage roof with lift-ready height accommodating 2 more vehicles, a new electrical panel, two hot water tanks, an upgraded Nutone Bluetooth intercom system, and a custom backyard shed with a private deck. Energy-efficient thermal windows and patio doors were added throughout the main level to enhance comfort year-round. Just minutes from Fountain Hills' charming shops, local restaurants, and the Avenue of the Fountains, this home also enjoys proximity to the upcoming International Dark Sky Discovery Center. Blending refined luxury with modern upgrades and exceptional views, this is a rare opportunity to own one of Fountain Hills' most special properties. This is more than a home - it's a lifestyle.",

    "text":"Stunning Frank Lloyd Wright-inspired custom home, designed by premier architects Bryan K. Rains of Rains Design and Beau H. Graffin of Graffin Design. This single-story masterpiece captures mountain views from every room, including the McDowells, Red Mountain, Four Peaks, and distant ranges. Perfectly situated on a nearly one-acre private cul-de-sac lot, the home blends architectural beauty with exceptional privacy. Recently transformed by an extensive $1M remodel, the property showcases the latest designer finishes throughout the interior, exterior, and grounds. Brand-new patios, lush landscaping, and thoughtfully curated outdoor living spaces create an unmatched setting for relaxation and entertainment. The home offers five bedrooms-each with its own private patio-and four bathrooms. Two of the bedrooms serve as full primary suites, both featuring private terraces and spectacular views. One primary suite enjoys unobstructed vistas of Red Mountain and sparkling night lights, while the other includes a beautiful fireplace and a host of premium features. One additional bedroom has been converted into a smart home theater. The impressive high-ceiling foyer and great room are wrapped in floor-to-ceiling glass, opening to a serene patio garden with fruit trees and flooding the home with natural light. Expansive windows and glass doors throughout the residence enhance the indoor-outdoor living experience. A generous, wraparound covered patio with custom wood ceilings accommodates multiple sitting areas as well as an outdoor kitchen. The resort-style backyard features a heated pool and spa, additional lounging spaces, and a real wood-burning fireplace. The entertainer's kitchen is truly a chef's delight, showcasing two large islands, cafe-style double ovens, a built-in plumbed coffee maker, and premium stainless-steel appliances.With every detail meticulously renewed, this immaculate home shows like new and is truly a must see.",

    "text":"Casa de Luz-a house of light, views, and quiet intention-rises gracefully above the Fountain Hills Botanical Garden on a large, private desert lot. From the moment you arrive, it becomes clear this is not simply a home, but a place meant to be felt. Natural light pours in from dawn to dusk, shifting gently through the day and creating an ever-changing dialogue between indoors and out. Expansive windows and thoughtfully placed balconies blur the line between living space and landscape, framing sweeping desert views while providing welcome shade from the summer sun. Here, mornings begin with soft light and birdsong, and evenings unfold beneath vast, star-filled skies-an experience elevated by Fountain Hills' renowned dark-sky setting. Designed in the late 20th century with... contemporary sensibility and purpose, Casa de Luz reflects an era when architecture honored both form and environment. Over time, the home has been lovingly stewarded by owners who respected its original character while guiding it forward. Updated systems, refined interiors, and redesigned landscaping ensure modern comfort, while preserving the soul and architectural integrity that make the home timeless. This is a residence that invites you to slow down, look outward, and reconnectwith nature, with light, and with the quiet beauty of desert living. Casa de Luz is something to experience, not just to see.",

Wolf and Sub-Zero appliances-including dual ovens with steam, gas and induction cooktops, a wine cooler, and warming drawer are paired with striking quartzite countertops and backsplash, sleek modern cabinetry with soft-close features, pendant lighting, and under-cabinet illumination. A reverse osmosis system with instant hot water adds everyday convenience to elevated design. Carrara marble tile floors flow through the main living spaces, grounding the home in timeless elegance. Natural gas connections extend throughout enhancing the living room fireplace, kitchen, backyard BBQ, fire pit, and pool heater while the main garage is EV-ready with a 14-50 outlet. Designed for lock-and-leave ease, the home is perfectly suited for seasonal living, featuring smart thermostats, interior and exterior shades, retractable screens, and a plumbing shutoff system thoughtfully bypassed for irrigation and fire suppression. Tucked within a prestigious gated community at the end of a quiet road, this residence offers rare privacy with only one neighboring home. Perched as the highest home in the development, it delivers some of the most commanding and awe-inspiring views in all of Fountain Hills, a true retreat where lifestyle, luxury, and location come together seamlessly.",

    "text":"Unmatched Views Timeless Architecture Modern Desert Luxury. Perched high above Fountain Hills, this extraordinary Santa Barbara-style estate captures breathtaking panoramic views of Red Rock, Four Peaks, the Fountain, Weaver's Needle, the McDowells, the Superstitions, and the Mazatzals. Originally designed by award-winning architect Hassan Jalaly, this custom residence underwent an extensive remodel in 2025, blending classic craftsmanship with refined modern upgrades. The result is a perfect harmony of elegance, comfort, and cutting-edge technology. The residence commands a rare 22-acre estate, offering a level of privacy and potential that is virtually impossible to find in today's market. These vast grounds ensure your sweeping vistas remain unspoiled and protected forever. The land is zoned for horses and provides the ideal setting to create a premier equestrian compound or even your own private par-3, 4 and 5 golf course. This is a unique opportunity to shape the land into your personal vision of desert luxury. Inside, soaring ceilings, stone and wood flooring, and walls of glass fill the 6, 215-square-foot floorplan with natural light. The grand living and dining spaces share a dramatic floor-to-ceiling two way fireplace with designer tile that embodies delicately balanced movement, creating a warm and sophisticated focal point. The newly refreshed kitchen is a true chef's delight, featuring marble countertops, premium Kohler fixtures, luxury Monogram appliances, dual stainless sinks with reverse osmosis, and an inviting breakfast nook that perfectly captures the morning sun. The main-level primary suite serves as a peaceful retreat with a wood burning, gas fireplace, cozy sitting area, and direct patio access. Its spa-like bath offers dual vanities, a jetted soaking tub, custom cabinetry, and the Kohler DTV digital shower system for an elevated experience. Upstairs, a private guest suite with a full wet bar and family room provides the ideal space for visiting family or friends. Every inch of this home reflects quality. The 2025 remodel introduced new flooring and fixtures throughout, complemented by a whole-home automation system, surround sound, security cameras, four zoned HVAC units, and a complete sprinkler system. Outside, a brand-new pool and spa anchor the spacious backyard, surrounded by professional landscaping and a full-length tiled veranda for dining and lounging. From sunrise over Four Peaks to starlit evenings by the pool, 16400 N Log Ln offers the very best of Fountain Hills.",

The thoughtful layout features two bedrooms configured with King and Queen beds, along with two full bathrooms, including a private primary ensuite. With convenient building amenities like elevator access, ample parking, a shared laundry room, and a lower-level relaxation patio, this is the ideal lock-and-leave property. Currently operating as an active VRBO with bookings already in place, it offers immediate cash flow for investors. For those looking to scale their real estate portfolio, we have additional units available in this building, presenting a rare opportunity to acquire multiple income-generating properties in a prime Arizona location.",

The condo itself has beautiful views of Four Peaks to the north, and if you're looking for a front row seat and easy parking to the 4th of July fireworks festival, farmers markets, and Octoberfest...you won't find it anywhere better than here! The condo itself is very spacious, bright, cosey, and offers you a blend of the southwest combined with modern appeal. New carpet, blinds, water heater, sunshade and fridge were added in the last 2 years. Beat that if you can!",

    "text":"Experience unmatched luxury and innovation in this Luxe Magazine Red Award-winning architectural masterpiece by Tsontakis Architecture with interiors by Emmy Couture. Perched atop one of the highest peaks in FireRock Country Club, this estate spans 1.8 acres and offers 360 degrees mountain and city views from five viewing decks. Defined by striking geometric design, the home features a 27,000-gallon negative-edge heated pool and spa with multi-zone misting, plus fully retractable Arcadia doors that blur the line between indoor and outdoor living. The chef's kitchen boasts Thermador, Sub-Zero, and Miele appliances, dual dishwashers, refrigerated wine storage, induction cooktop, double ovens, and a built-in coffee station. Custom black walnut paneling and doors, designer tile, and Control4 home automation set a new standard in modern luxury. An elevator connects all three levels: a lower-level in-home casita, a main floor with kitchen, living, great room with floating staircase and stone fireplace, and a third-level primary suite with sunrise views, steam shower, freestanding tub, and safe room. Additional highlights include a 4-car garage with a 7,000+ sf paver driveway, professionally landscaped grounds with turf, native plants, and dramatic lighting. Engineered for independence, the residence produces 50,000 kWh annually via 85 solar panels and is backed by 6 Tesla Powerwalls with SPAN smart panels. A private water reservoir, whole-home filtration, and gas\/propane integration complete its self-sustaining design. This is more than a home it is a statement of vision, strength, and timeless design.",
