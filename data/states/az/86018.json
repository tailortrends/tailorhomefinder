    "text":"Priced to Sell, under $600K for a very high-performing Airbnb\/VRBO that is entirely TURNKEY. $89K in remodel, including a new hot tub, flooring, a new electric panel, 3 new mini-splits, and high-end furniture. The home comes COMPLETELY FURNISHED plus FUTURE BOOKINGS and huge tax benefits with 100% COST SEGREGATION in 2026. This is a rare find: the home is essentially off-grid yet maintains a modern feel and functionality. Just 30 min from Flagstaff and just 2 hours from Phoenix, making it the perfect 2nd home\/weekend getaway and an INCOME-PRODUCING property, truly the best of both worlds! Past guests love being so close to the Grand Canyon and the Polar Express. Set on a beautiful wooded 5-acre lot with two large decks and a jacuzzi, perfect for stargazing. BONUS: Seller owns an old airplane that has been remodeled into an Airbnb that can be purchased as well, which would easily propel (no pun intended) gross earnings north of $100K with the NOVELTY factor. Please get in touch with the listing agent for more information.",
