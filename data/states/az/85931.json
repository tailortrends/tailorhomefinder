    "text":"Exquisite Mountain Estate Bordering Sitgreaves National Forest This meticulously designed mountain estate offers a rare opportunity to own private land directly bordering the Sitgreaves National Forest, providing a genuine sanctuary and direct access to miles of USFS trails. Nestled in the exclusive ''island'' community of Forest Lakes atop the Mogollon Rim at approximately 7,600 feet elevation, the property is set in the middle of the world's largest stand of Ponderosa Pines. Residents enjoy some of the best summer weather in the world, with average temperatures 30 to 50 degrees cooler than the Phoenix Valley, which is just a scenic two-hour drive away. The exterior of the home is designed for both beauty and ease of care. The backyard is meticulously terraced with stone walls and features lush synthetic turf, creating a low-maintenance and visually stunning landscape that frames breathtaking views of the bordering forest. Because the property sits on the edge of the USFS, your back-door neighbors are truly nature's finest, including elk, deer, and wild horses. Inside and out, no expense is being spared in the construction of this exquisite home. The entire structure, including the stem walls, is insulated with the best closed-cell foam to ensure unparalleled energy efficiency and soundproofing. High-end architectural details are found throughout; even the covered patio and all eaves of the dwelling feature dramatic beamed ceilings with tongue and groove, extending the home's luxury to the outdoor living spaces. A concrete paver driveway leads to a massive three-plus car garage, providing ample space for vehicles and storage. This location is an outdoor enthusiast's dream. In addition to the endless forest trails, some of the best trout fishing in the Western USA is just minutes away at numerous Rim Lakes, such as Woods Canyon Lake and Willow Springs Lake, along with streams teeming with wild trout. Because the home is currently under construction, discerning buyers have the unique opportunity to make selections for items such as paint colors, decorator items, and flooring until these elements have been installed, allowing for full personalization. For safety during the construction phase, tours are available by scheduled appointment only and must be accompanied by a member of the listing team.",
